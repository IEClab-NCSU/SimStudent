title:x-2=5
text: You might first add 2 to both sides, by typing 'add 2' for the transformation.  Why?  Because that way you will have 'x' by itself on the left-hand side.  As you see, the constant term '-2' is eliminated, the left-hand side becomes 'x' and the right-hand side becomes '7'.

section:1
title: 3y+4=10
text: You need to eliminate the constant term '+4' and the coefficient '3'. To eliminate '+4' you would subtract 4 from both sides. This would give you '3x' on the left hand side. Then to eliminate 3, you would divide both sides by 3. Remember, you need to apply an arithmetic operators (i.e., add, subtract, multiply, divide) to both sides to maintain the quality of the equation.

section:1
title:-2=(p+4)/3
text:  First, to eliminate the denominator of the fraction (p+4)/3, you would multiply both sides by 3. The parenthesis is gone and you can subtract 4 to eliminate the contant term +4 and get p by itself. And now you have p by itself on the right-hand side of the equation.
shortDescription: In this example, because the right-hand side of the equation uses parentheses, you have to get rid of terms outside the parentheses first to get 'p' by itself.

dorminTable3_C1R2:subtract 4::correct:Subtract 4 from both sides to eliminate the constant term 4 on the right-hand side
dorminTable1_C1R3:-10::correct:If you subtract -4 from -6 you get -10.
dorminTable2_C1R3:p::correct: On the right hand side you have p by itself.
done:-1:The problem is solved.  The answer is -10 = p.  The isolated variable can also be on the right-hand side.:correct:The problem is solved.  The answer is p=-10.

title: 5x+6 = 3x+4
text: Start by subtracting 6 from both sides, to eliminate term 6 from the right-hand side. Then you should subtract 3x to gather your variable terms on the left-hand side. Finally, to get x by itself you need to divide by 2. 
shortDescription: This equation has variables on both sides. How can you solve it?
dorminTable1_C1R1:5x+6:How can I get rid of the term 6?:This is the left-hand side of the equation:.

dorminTable3_C1R1:subtract 6::correct:Eliminate 6 on the left-hand side by subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation.
dorminTable1_C1R2:5x::correct:Now you have 2x on the left hand side.
dorminTable2_C1R2:3x-2::correct:Subtracting 6 from 3x+4 would give you 3x-2.
dorminTable3_C1R2:subtract 3x::correct:Subtract 3x from both sides to eliminate 3x on the right-hand side.

title: 2y-3 = 6-y
text: Start by adding 3 to both sides, to eliminate term ‘-3’ from the right-hand side. Then you should add ‘y’ to gather your variable terms on the left-hand side. Finally, to get ‘y’ by itself you need to divide by ‘3’. 
shortDescription: This equation has variables on both sides. How can you solve it?
dorminTable1_C1R1:2y-3:How can I get rid of the term -3?:This is the left-hand side of the equation.:.
