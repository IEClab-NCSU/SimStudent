<h2>Welcome to Teacher's Toolkit</h2>

<p>Teacher's Toolkit provides an easy to use interface for
performing administrative tasks associated with the Cognitive Tutor
programs.  Such tasks typically include:</p>

<UL>
<LI><P>Creating new class rosters at the beginning of a term to generate
the necessary files for students to use the tutor.</p>

<LI><p>Tracking student progress as they work through the tutor curriculum
and printing class summary or individual progress reports.</p>

<LI><p>Maintaining class rosters by changing student names, transferring
students to different classes, or removing students.</p>

<LI><p>Restarting a problem, skipping to the next problem, or changing the
placement within the curriculum for a student.</p>

<LI><p>Deleting class rosters once the term is over.</p>

</UL>

<p>The Teacher's Toolkit screen interface is divided into the four
areas illustrated above. These areas include:</p>

<P><B>Title Bar</b>

<p>This area displays the name of the screen that is currently
displayed. For example, if you are creating a class 
roster, you would see "Teacher's Toolkit: Create Class" the title bar.</p>

<P>
<B>Task List Panel</b>

<p>This area on the left side of the
screen displays all the tasks that you can perform using Teacher's Toolkit.
There are four task categories:</p>
<UL>
<LI>Class Roster Maintenance
<LI>Curriculum-Related Tasks
<LI>Instructor Tasks
<LI>Reports
</UL>

<P>Each task category contains a list of
associated tasks. You can expand (open) or contract (close) a category list by
clicking on the arrow to the left of the category name, or on the name itself.
If you move the mouse over the task or category name, a pop-up <i>Task
Tip</i> displays with a brief description of the task or category. To
choose a task, simply click on the task name.</p>

<P>
<B>Task Panel</B>

<p>The Task Panel is the main working area
for completing a task. Once you select a task, this area displays a help
message, information and prompts associated with the task.  At the bottom of the task panel are action
buttons that allow you to finish the task once you have entered all necessary
information.  Later sections of this
document provide a detailed description of each task's Task Panel.</p>

<P>
<B>Status Message Panel</B>

<p>This area displays messages about the
application's status, or confirmation messages about a completed task. For
example, when you first access a screen you'll see "Ready" displayed, which
indicates that the application is ready to process data.  When you perform a task such as restarting a
problem for a student, you'll see a message confirming that the problem has
been restarted.</p>
