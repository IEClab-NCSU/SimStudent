This directory contains files needed to deploy the tutoring engine as an applet 
and example files for running a Flash AS3 interface on your own web server. This
example will only run if it is deployed to a web server, such as Apache.

=====
1) Copy the 'ctat_applet' folder to the root of your web server. For example, if
   you are using Apache, the root would be the 'htdocs' directory.

2) Copy the 'FlashExample' folder from 'examples' to the root of your web server.

3) Copy the 'fractionAddition.swf' file from
   <ctat-home>/Projects/FlashFractionAddition to the FlashExample directory on 
   your web server.

4) Copy the '1416.brd' file from 
   <ctat-home>/Projects/FlashFractionAddition/ExampleTracingProblems to the 
   FlashExample directory on your web server.

5) Copy the 'javascript' folder to the 'FlashExample' directory on your web 
   server.

6) Open the example in your browser: 
   http://<server URL>/FlashExample/FlashFractionAddition.html (where the value
   '<server URL>' is the full host name, not 'localhost').
