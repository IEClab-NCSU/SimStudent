title:x-2=5
text:For this one-step equation, you might first add 2 to both sides.  Why?  Because that way you will have x by itself on the left-hand side.  If you add 2 to the left-hand side, it will be x-2+2, which simplifies to x.  The right-hand side will be 5+2, which simplifies to 7.  So, you first type "add 2" for the transformation, and then type x in the left-hand side, and 7 in the right-hand side.  Always remember, you need to apply an arithmetic operator (i.e., add, subtract, multiply, divide) to both sides to maintain the quality of the equation. 
dorminTable1_C1R1:x-2:This is the left-hand side of the equation.
dorminTable1_C1R2:x:If you add 2 to x-2, you'll get x.:correct
dorminTable2_C1R1:5:This is the right-hand side of the equation.
dorminTable2_C1R2:7:If you add 2 to 5, you'll get 7.:correct
dorminTable3_C1R1:add 2:Your first step may be to add 2 to both sides.:correct
done:-1:The problem is solved.  The answer is x=7.:correct

title:3a=15
text:This is another example of a one-step equation.  What do you need to do to have x by itself on the left-hand side?  Yes, you need to divide both sides by 3.  You may use any letter for a variable when solving an equation.  This example uses the letter 'a'. 
dorminTable1_C1R1:3a:The variable a has a coefficient of 3.
dorminTable2_C1R1:15:This is a constant term of 15.
dorminTable3_C1R1:divide 3:Divide both sides by 3 to get the variable a by itself.:correct
dorminTable1_C1R2:a:3a divided by 3 is a.:correct
dorminTable2_C1R2:5:15 divided by 3 is 5.:correct
done:-1:The problem is solved.  The answer is a = 5.:correct

title:3y+4=10
text:This is an example of a two-step equation. To get the variable y by itself, you need to eliminate the constant term +4 and the coefficient 3.  To eliminate +4, you would subtract 4 from both sides.  Then to eliminate 3, divide both sides by 3.
dorminTable1_C1R1:3y+4
dorminTable2_C1R1:10
dorminTable3_C1R1:subtract 4:Subtract 4 from both sides to eliminate the constant term 4 on the left-hand side.:correct

title:-2=(p+4)/3
text: To get the variable p by itself on the right-hand side, you need to eliminate the constants 3 and 4 on the right-hand side.  Because the right-hand side of the equation uses parentheses, you have to get rid of terms outside the parentheses first.  That is, to get the variable p by itself, you might first eliminate 3, which is a denominator of the fraction (p+4)/3.  To eliminate 3, you might multiply both sides by 3.
dorminTable1_C1R1:-2
dorminTable2_C1R1: (p+4)/3
dorminTable3_C1R1:multiply 3:First, eliminate the denominator of the fraction (p+4)/3.:correct
dorminTable1_C1R2: -6::correct
dorminTable2_C1R2: p+4::correct
dorminTable3_C1R2:subtract 4:Subtract 4 from both sides to eliminate the constant term 4 on the right-hand side:correct
dorminTable1_C1R3:-10::correct
dorminTable2_C1R3:p::correct
done:-1:The problem is solved.  The answer is -10 = p.  The isolated variable can also be on the right-hand side.:correct

title:3(2q-5)=12q
text:This is an example of an equation with variables on both sides, but this equation has parentheses. To get the variable q by itself, you need to eliminate 3, 2, -5, and 12. Which one should you eliminate first?  One way to eliminate '3' is to distribute 3 over the parentheses.  There are three things to be eliminated on the left-hand side: 3, 2 and -5.  After you distribute 3, you would have only two things to be eliminated: 6 and -15.  See the example above. 
dorminTable1_C1R1:3(2q-5)
dorminTable2_C1R1:12q
dorminTable3_C1R1:distribute 3(2q-5):After distributing 3 over the parentheses, you would only have two things to eliminate.:correct

dorminTable2_C1R3:6q::correct
dorminTable3_C1R3:divide 6:To eliminate 6 on the right-hand side, you would divide both sides by 6.:correct
dorminTable1_C1R4:-5/2::correct
dorminTable2_C1R4:q::correct
done:-1:The problem is solved.  The answer is -5/2 = q. It's fine to have an improper fraction as an answer.:correct

title:-3+4b+8=-6-6b
text:This is an example of an equation with variables on both sides, but the left-hand side of this equation has two constant terms, -3 and 8.  You should combine these two terms first, because that way you would get a simpler equation that has only two terms on the left-hand side.  You may use 'clt' as an abbreviation for combine like terms.
dorminTable1_C1R1:-3+4b+8
dorminTable2_C1R1:-6-6b
dorminTable3_C1R1:clt -3+4b+8:clt means combine like terms.  Specify the side of the equation to be combined.:correct
