ADD_OR_SUBTRACT_VARIABLE_TERM_OPERATOR
"Why cannot we get rid of the constant term first? Can you provide an example where I could get rid of the constant term first?"
"Does it matter which sides' variable term are we getting rid of first?"
"How do you select which side to start cancelling out the variable terms?"

ADD_POSITIVE_OPERATOR
"Tutor, we cancel out a negative number by adding a positive number. Can you state an equation where I might have to add a negative number?" 
"Tutor, by adding, we are giving a number back to this equation. What would happen if I take away the extra number beside the variable term by performing subtract operation? Can you explain the outcome with proper example?" 
"Tutor, I was wondering why didn’t we simply take away the negative number by performing subtract operation? Can you explain with an appropriate example?" 
"Do we only add a positive number? Can you tell me an example where I might have to add a negative number?"

ADD_WHOLE_NUMBER_OPERATOR
"Can we only add a whole number to the equation? Can you state an equation where I might have to add a fraction?"

ADD	
"I noticed that we are always performing the opposite operation. for example: if I have a number subtracted then we add the same number to make it 0. What would happen if I subtracted the opposite number? Would it give me the same result? Can you explain with examples?"
"I know I can apply add here. Is there any other transformation that may give the same outcome?"

SUBTRACT_POSITIVE_OPERATOR
"Tutor, I can see that you are taking away positive number by performing subtract. Can you state an equation where I might have to take away a negative number? meaning, I might have to perform "subtract negative number"?" 
"Do we only subtract a positive number? Can you tell me an example equation where I might have to subtract a negative number?"

SUBTRACT_WHOLE_NUMBER_OPERATOR
"Can we only subtract a whole number from the equation? Can you tell me an equation where I might have to subtract a fraction?"

SUBTRACT
"I noticed that we are always performing the opposite operation. for example: if I have a number added then we subtract to make it 0. What would happen if I added the opposite number? Would it give me the same result? Can you explain with examples?"
"I know I can apply subtract here. Is there any other transformation that may give the same outcome?"
"Is subtracting a number the only right action that can be taken at this state of equation?"

DIVIDE_POSITIVE_OPERATOR
"Do we only divide by a positive number? Can you give me an example where I might have to divide by a negative number?"

DIVIDE_WHOLE_NUMBER_OPERATOR
"I have noticed that the coefficient is a whole number but not a fraction. Does the coefficient can only be a whole number?"
"Tutor, I am dividing here because I have a number multiplied with variable. Is it possible that sometimes the number is not multiplied with variable? How to deal with those situations?"

DIVIDE
"So far, I have always used divide operation to eliminate the coefficient. Do we have any alternative to divide operation in order to eliminate the coefficient term?"
"I noticed that we are always performing the opposite operation. for example: if I have a number multiplied then we divide to cancel that out. What would happen if I multiplied by the inverse number? Would it give me the same result? Can you explain with examples?"
"I know I can apply divide here. Is there any other transformation that may give the same outcome?"
"Is divide by a number the only right action that can be taken at this state of equation?"

MULTIPLY_POSITIVE_OPERATOR
"Can you explain what are the things that I may need to be careful about when I multiply by a negative number? Please explain with proper examples for my better understanding"

MULTIPLY_WHOLE_NUMBER_OPERATOR
"Tutor, I know how to multiply by a whole number. Can you show me how to multiply by a fraction in an equation and an example equation of where I may need to use that?"

MULTIPLY
"Tutor, could we have somehow applied divide to achieve the same outcome as multiply?"
"I noticed that we are always performing the opposite operation. for example: if I have a number divided then we multiply to cancel that out. What would happen if I divided by the inverse number instead? Would it give me the same result? Can you explain with examples?"
"I know I can apply multiply here. Is there any other transformation that may give the same outcome?"
"Is multiply by a number the only right action that can be taken at this state of equation?"

DONE
"How do we know for sure that the equation is solved?"
"How can we always make sure that our solution is correct?"
"Is there any way to ensure that we did not do any mistake in solving this equation?"

ANY
"Is <i> the only right action that can be taken at this state of equation?"
"Tutor, is <i> the only correct transformation to be applied in the equation?"
"Can you present some other examples for which <i> can be applied?"
"Can you provide some other example of equations where I can apply <i>?"
"Please tell me some other example of equations where I can apply <i>?"
"Can you state some example equations where I can safely apply <i>?"
"Can you state another equation for which I could have applied <i>?"
