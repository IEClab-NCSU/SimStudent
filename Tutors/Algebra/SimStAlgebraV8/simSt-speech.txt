STEP_CORRECT
Yes, based on the previous steps, <i> would be correct here.
Yes, <i> would be correct here.
Yes, putting <i> <s> seems reasonable to me.
Yes, I don't see any reason why you shouldn't use <i> <s>.

STEP_INCORRECT
No, <i> would not be the correct thing to do here right now.
No, I don't think putting <i> <s> is the best move right now.
No, at this point in the problem, it would not be correct to put <i> here.

CHECK_ANSWER
Okay, then, let's see if the solution is correct.   I'd plug <i> in for <o> in the original equation, which is <s>.
Now to check if the answer is right, I would plug <i> in for <o> in the original problem, <s>.

NO_VAR_VALUE_CHECK_ANS
Oh, wait!  I can't find a number to plug in for the variable!

PLUG_IN
It looks like in the <s> I have <i>, so that becomes <o>.<A0>
Okay, in the <s> is <i>, which makes it <o>.<A0>
Then <i> is in the <s> so that becomes <o>.<A2>
<i> <s> becomes <o>.
And in the <s> <i> makes <o>.<A2>
<i> <s> makes <o>.
And in the <s> <i> becomes <o>.<A2>

NO_VAR_TO_PLUG
Then in the <s> I have <o>.
And in the <s> I have <o>. <A2>
<o> is in the <s>.

BALANCE_CHECK_ANSWER
Okay, <i> and <o> are equal, so I think that is the correct answer.
<i> and <o> are equal, so that means the problem should be right.
<i> and <o> are balanced, so I think the answer is right.
And <i> is equal to <o>, so I think the answer is right.
<i> and <o> are equal.
Oh, good! <i> and <o> are balanced!
It looks right! <i> and <o> are the same!

NO_BALANCE_CHECK_ANSWER
Oh, <i> and <o> are not equal.
But <i> and <o> are not equal.
Oh, wait! <i> and <o> don't balance!
Oh, wait! <i> and <o> aren't equal!

VERIFY_WRONG
I think the answer is wrong.  Let's restart the problem and try again.
I don't think the answer is right.  I wonder what I did wrong!  I think we should restart the problem.
I think I must have made a mistake.  Let's restart the problem and try again.
I think I must have made a mistake.  I wonder what I did wrong!  I think we should restart the problem.
I don't think the answer is right.  I'd like to restart the problem.
I think I must have made a mistake.  I'd like to restart the problem.

CONFIRM
Okay.

SKIPPED
No? Okay.
Alright.
Moving on then.

UNDO_CONFIRM_STEPS
Okay.  I would erase these steps back through <o>.  Should I go ahead?

NOTHING_TO_UNDO
But we haven't gotten through any work on this problem yet!

UNDO_RESUME
Alright.  Back to working on the problem from here.  Let me think what I should do.

UNDO_SHOULD_DO
Alright.  I erased <o>.  Now let me think what I should do instead...

UNDO_REMEMBER_PREVIOUS
I remember I was trying to <o>.

NO_UNDO
Okay, then.  Now, where was I...

NO_UNDO_DONE
Okay, then I'm still done with this problem.  What should I do now?

NO_UNDO_FAIL_TO_LEARN
Okay, then I'm still confused.  Let's move on to another problem.

FEEDBACK_NEGATIVE
Oh, I understand <i> is wrong here.
Oh, not <i>. 
Ok, my bad! 
Oops! Okay, so <i> is wrong.
So <i> won't work here. 

FEEDBACK_NEGATIVE_DONE
Oh, I understand clicking the problem is solved button is wrong here. Let me think!
Oh, the problem is not done yet!
I see there is still work to be done for this problem. Let me think!
Hm... so problem is not done. Lets see!

ASKING_IF_TUTOR_KNOWS_STEP
I think I do not know what to do here. Do you know the next step?
I am not sure about my next step. Do you know what step should be performed now?

BRAINSTORMING_QUESTION_TRANFORMATION
I could perform <i> if I had <problem> because <logic>. Can you demonstrate the steps that would lead me to that point from the current situation?
I could perform <i> if I had <problem> because <logic>. Can you show me how to get to that point from the current situation?

Oops! It seems like we both are stuck. Let me share some ideas from what I have learnt.
I see. Let me rack my brain to find a way out from what you have taught me already.

BRAINSTORMING_QUESTION_WHEN_NO_FEATURE_FOUND
This situation is also entirely new for me. Would you like to ask Mr. Williams to see if he can help us?
I searched through my already learned knowledge but could not find anything to help us out. May be Mr. Williams or the resources (unit overview or examples tab) can help you. Would you like to review them?
