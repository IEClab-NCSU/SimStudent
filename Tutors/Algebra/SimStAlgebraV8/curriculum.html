<h2 style="margin:4px"> Key Terms </h2>
<p style="margin:2px;"> Important words and definitions:
<ul>
<li><b>Term</b>: In the equation -2x+3 = 3x+5-7x, there are five terms, which are "-2x", "3", "3x", "5", and "-7x". There are two types of terms, constant terms and variable terms.
	<ul>
		<li> A <b>constant term</b> does not have a letter. Some examples are 3,-3,16,-12, 1/2. In the equation above, the "3" and "5" are constant terms</li>
		<li> A <b>variable term</b> has a letter, Some examples are x,3x,-3b,-7c. In the equation above, "-2x", "3x" and "-7x" are variable terms.</li>
	</ul>
Notice that the minus sign is a part of the term: the last term in "3x+5-7x" is "-7x", not "7x".
<br>
Also notice that you don't have to include the plus sign for the 3 or the 5: it is understood that terms without a sign are positive. Therefore, the second term on the left-hand side can be written as 3 or +3.
</li>
<br>
<li><b>Coefficient</b>: A coefficient is the number associated with a variable term.
<ul>
<li>the coefficient of the variable term 2y is 2</li>
<li>the coefficient of the variable term -4a is -4</li>
<li>the coefficient of the variable term 3x/4 is 3/4</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b>Like terms</b>: Like terms are terms that have identical variables and exponents.
<ul>
<li>Constant terms are always like terms with each other.</li>
	<ul>
	<li> 2 and 7 are like terms</li>
	<li> 14 and 35 are like terms</li>
	<li> -3 and 5 are like terms</li>
	<li> 1/3 and 7 are like terms</li>
	</ul>
<li>Variable terms are only like terms if the variables are the same (and the exponents are the same)</li>
	<ul>
	<li> x and 2x are like terms</li>
	<li> 3b and 4b are like terms</li>
	<li> 3x and -2x are like terms</li>
	<li> x/2 and x/7 are like terms</li>
	<li> in the expression 3c-2+5-4c, "3c" and "-4c" are like terms; "-2" and "+5" are like terms.</li>
	<li> 3b and 3x are NOT like terms because the variable letters do not match</li>
	<li> 4 and 2x are NOT like terms because 4 is a constant term and 2x is a variable term</li>
	</ul>

</ul>
 </li>

<li><b>Fractions</b>: On the computer, it is common to use the letter '/' to represent a fraction. So, 3a/3 is 3a over 3, which means 3a divided by 3.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h1 style="margin:4px"> Example Solutions</h1>
<p style="margin:2px;">To solve an equation you need to do mathematical transformations until at the end you have "x=a number", for example <em>x</em>=-2.   To solve a complex equation, you may need to do multiple transformations. </p>
<p style="margin:2px;">What is a "transformation"?  Let's think about how to solve the following example:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: none;"><li>	-2<em>x</em>-6 = 4+3<em>x</em></li></ul>
What does this equation mean?   Yes, it means that -2<em>x</em>-6 and 4+3<em>x</em> are equal.  In other words, "multiplying -2 and <em>x</em> and subtracting 6 from it" is equal to "the sum of 4 and 3 times <em>x</em>".
Now, think about the following question.   If -2<em>x</em>-6 and 4+3<em>x</em> are equal, then which of the following is bigger: -2<em>x</em>-6+6 or 4+3<em>x</em>+6?   Yes, they are the same!!
So, this means the following:
<ul style="list-style-type: none;"><li>		-2<em>x</em>-6+6 = 4+3<em>x</em>+6</li></ul>
What does this tell you?  This tells you that <strong>if you have an equation (i.e., -2<em>x</em>-6=4+3<em>x</em>), adding the same number (i.e., 6) to both sides would maintain the equivalence!</strong>  'So what?' you ask?  Look at the above equation carefully.  What will you get if you combine like terms (which are -6 and 6) on the left-hand side?   Yes, only -2<em>x</em>!
<ul style="list-style-type: none;"><li>		-2<em>x</em>=4+3<em>x</em>+6</li></ul>
After combining like terms (which are 4 and 6), the right hand-side becomes 10+3<em>x</em>
<ul style="list-style-type: none;"><li>		-2<em>x</em>=10+3<em>x</em></li></ul>
Okay, let's summarize what was going on.  You wanted to solve the following equation:
<ul style="list-style-type: none;"><li>		-2<em>x</em>-6 = 4+3<em>x</em></li></ul>
So, you added 6 to both sides (because it would keep the equivalence of the equation):
<ul style="list-style-type: none;"><li>		-2<em>x</em>-6 = 4+3<em>x</em>		add 6 (to <strong>both sides</strong>)</li></ul>
As a consequence, the original equation is now <em>transformed</em> into the following equation:
<ul style="list-style-type: none;"><li>		-2<em>x</em> = 10+3<em>x</em></li></ul>
<p>If you compare the two equations, -2<em>x</em>-6=4+3<em>x</em> and -2<em>x</em>=10+3<em>x</em>, you would notice that by adding 6 to both sides, you have eliminated the constant term of -6 from the left-hand side. </p>
<p>Easy, isn't it?   This is how you solve equations -- equation solving is eliminating terms one at time and transforming the equation into simpler one.</p>
<p>Addition is not the only operation for a transformation.   You can subtract, multiply, or divide.   You can also add (or subtract, or multiply, or divide) a <em>variable term</em>.   Indeed, for the above equation, you may want to subtract 3<em>x</em> from both sides:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: none;"><li>		-2<em>x</em> = 10+3<em>x</em>		subtract 3<em>x</em> (from <strong>both sides</strong>)</li></ul>
Not sure why?   What would you get if you subtract 3<em>x</em> from -2<em>x</em>?  Yes, -5<em>x</em>.  What about subtracting 3<em>x</em> from 10+3<em>x</em>?   Yes, you'd get 10.   As a result you get the following equation, in which the variable term '3x' on the right-hand side has been eliminated:
<ul style="list-style-type: none;"><li>		-5<em>x</em> = 10</li></ul>
Now, there is one last step to solve this equation.  You may want to divide both sides by -5, because -5<em>x</em> divided by -5 would be <em>x</em>:
<ul style="list-style-type: none;"><li>		-5<em>x</em> = 10		divide (<strong>both sides</strong> by) -5</li></ul>
which results in the following equation:
<ul style="list-style-type: none;"><li>		<em>x</em> = -2</li></ul>
In summary, to solve the equation -2<em>x</em>-6 = 4+3<em>x</em>, you applied three transformations:
<br><br>
<table> <tr><td width="20"></td><td width="150" > -2<em>x</em>-6 = 4+3<em>x</em> </td><td> add 6 </td></tr>
<tr><td width="20"></td><td width="150" >-2<em>x</em> = 10+3<em>x</em></td><td> subtract 3<em>x</em></li></td></tr>
<tr><td width="20"></td><td width="150" >-5<em>x</em> = 10    </td><td>  divide -5</li></td></tr>
<tr><td width="20"></td><td width="150" ><em>x</em> = -2</li></ul></td></tr>
</table>

<h2 style="margin:4px">Another Example</h2>

<p style="margin:2px;"> Let's review how to solve the equation <em>3p-8=10</em> </p>
<table style="background: #D5D7CC;padding: 5px">
<tr>
	<td width="20"></td>
	<td width="150" border="1"> Equation</td>
	<td width="150" border="1">Transformation</td>
	<td width="400" border="1">Explanation</td>
	<td width="20" > </td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td width="20"></td>
	<td width="150" border="1" >3p-8 = 10</td>
	<td width="150" border="1" >add 8</td>
	<td width="400" border="1">You may first add 8 to both sides.  Why?  Because if you add 8 to both sides, then the left-hand side of the resulting equation would be 3p.</td>
	<td width="20"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td width="20"></td>
	<td width="150" border="1" >3p = 18</td>
	<td width="150" border="1" >divide 3</td>
	<td width="400" border="1">Now, you may want to divide both sides by 3, which is the coefficient of 3p.</td>
	<td width="20"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td width="20"></td>
	<td width="150" border="1" >p = 6</td>
	<td width="150" border="1" >Problem Solved!</td>
	<td width="400" border="1">Of course, a solution can be a fraction!!</td>
	<td width="20"></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>So the solution to the equation is <em>p=6</em>.</p>

<h2 style="margin:4px;">Verifying the Solution</h2>

<p style="margin:2px;"> To verify that a solution is correct, substitute the solution into the original equation and see if the value of the left-hand side is equal to the value of the right-hand side.  If you substitute <em>p</em> with <em>6</em> for <em>3p-8</em>, you get <em>3*6-8</em>, which is <em>10</em>. This value is equal to the value of the right-hand side.   So, <em>p=6</em> is a correct solution of the original equation.</p>

<br><hr>
<h2 style="margin:4px;"> One More Example</h2>
<p style="margin:2px;"> What about equations like 3 = 4/<em>a</em>?  This equation looks tricky, because the variable is the denominator of the fraction.</p>

	<td width="400" border="1">You may want to multiply both sides by a. That way, the right-hand side would become 4 and the left-hand side will be 3a.</td>

	<td width="400" border="1">Now, the equation looks familiar.  You would divide both sides by 3, wouldn't you?</td>
	<td width="20"></td>
</tr>

<div id="skills" style="background: #D5D7CC;padding: 5px" >
<h2 style="margin:4px;">Skills</h2>
<p style="margin:2px;">In this unit you will learn to:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Add to both sides of an equation</b>: you can add either a constant term or a variable term to both sides of an equation.
	<ul>
	<li>Example: for the equation 2x-3=5, to eliminate "-3" on the left-hand side, you can "add 3" to both sides.</li>
	<li>Example: for the equation 12-4x=2x, to eliminate "4x" on the left-hand side, you can "add 4x" to both sides</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li id="subtract"><b>Subtract from both sides of an equation</b>: you can subtract either a constant term or a variable term from both sides of an equation.
	<ul>
	<li>Example: for the equation -6+2x=-5x, to eliminate "2x" on the left-hand side, you can "subtract 2x" from both sides.</li>
	<li>Example: for the equation 3+4x=5, to eliminate "3" on the left-hand side, you can "subtract 3" from both sides</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Multiply both sides of an equation</b>: you can multiply both sides of an equation by either a variable term or a constant term.
<ul>
	<li>Example: for the equation 2/x=10, you can multiply both sides of the equation by "x" to eliminate x from the denominator fo the fraction on the left-hand side term. The result would be "2=10x".</li>
	<li>Example: for the equation (x+3)/4=3, you can multiply both sides of the equation by "4" to eliminate 4 from the denominator of the left-hand side term. The result would be "x+3=12". </li>
	</ul>
 </li>
<li><b>Divide both sides of an equation</b>: you may divide both sides of an equation by a constant term.
	<ul>
	<li>Example: you can divide both sides of the equation -3x=12 by -3. The result would be "x=-4"</li>
	<li>Example: you can divide both sides of the equation 2x=4 by 2. The result would be "x=2"</li>
	</ul>
 </li>
<li><b>Combine like terms</b>: Like terms in an equation can be combined.
	<ul>
	<li>Example: for the equation  -3+2y+7 = 5y-3+y., <b>-3 and 7 on the left-hand side become 4</b> when combined (-3+7 is equal to 4). On the right hand side, <b>5y and y become 6y</b> when combined (5y+y is 6y). As a result of combining like terms, the equation -3+2y+7=5y-3+y becomes 4+2y=6y-3.</li>
	<li>Example: for the equation 6x+4=2x+16, after you combine like terms (across the equal sign) it becomes 4x=12.</li>
