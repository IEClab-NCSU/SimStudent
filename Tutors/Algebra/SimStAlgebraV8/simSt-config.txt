title:5=x+2
text:You might first subtract 2 to both sides, by typing 'subtract 2' for the transformation.  Why?  Because that way you will have 'x' by itself on the right-hand side.  As you see, the constant term '2' is eliminated, the right-hand side becomes 'x' and the right-hand side becomes '3'. 
shortDescription:This is a one step equation. For your first step you would eliminate the constant term, which is +2, from the right-hand side. To do so, you subtract 2 from both sides. 
dorminTable1_C1R1:5:How can I have x by itself?.:This is the left-hand side of the equation.:.
dorminTable2_C1R1:x+2:This is the right-hand side of the equation.
dorminTable3_C1R1:subtract 2::correct:So, you type <font color="#00FF00" face="Times New Roman" size="5"> subtract 2 </font> on the transformation. The next step is to subtract 2 from the left-hand side, which means 5-2. 
dorminTable1_C1R2:3:Now I have 3 on the left side.:correct:So, you type <font color="#00FF00" face="Times New Roman" size="5"> 3 </font> on the left-hand side, because subtracting 2 from 5 gives you 3. The next step is to subtract 2 from the right-hand side, which means x+2-2.
dorminTable2_C1R2:x:Now I have x all by it self.:correct:So, you type <font color="#00FF00" face="Times New Roman" size="5"> x </font> on the right hand side, because subtracting 2 from x+2 gives you x. The problem is now solved! For the next step, you should click the [Problem is Solved] button.
