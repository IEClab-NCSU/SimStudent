title:5=x+2
text: You might first subtract 2 to both sides, by typing 'subtract 2' for the transformation.  Why?  Because that way you will have 'x' by itself on the right-hand side.  As you see, the constant term '2' is eliminated, the left-hand side becomes '3' and the right-hand side becomes 'x'.
shortDescription: This is a one-step equation because you need to manipulate the equation only once to get the <a href="curriculum.html#KeyTerms" title="A letter in an equation is called the variable."><font color="#00F7FF" face="Times New Roman" size="5"> variable </font></a> 'x' by itself, with no numbers beside it.:on_paper/E1.png

dorminTable1_C1R2:3:Now I have 3 on the left side.: Now you would write <font color="#00FF00" face="Times New Roman" size="5"> 3 </font> because subtract 2 from the left-hand side means 5-2 which is 3.:correct:on_paper/E14.png
dorminTable2_C1R2:x:Now I have x all by it self.: In this step, you would write <font color="#00FF00" face="Times New Roman" size="5"> x </font> because subtract 2 from the right-hand side means x+2-2. This becomes x.:correct:on_paper/E15.png

title:3a=5
text:   You need to divide both sides by 3 to have 'a' by itself on the left-hand side of the equation. Remember that you may use any letter for a variable when solving an equation.  This example uses the letter 'a'.
shortDescription: This is another one-step equation because you will manipulate the equation only once to get the <a href="curriculum.html#KeyTerms" title="A letter in an equation is called the variable."><font color="#00F7FF" face="Times New Roman" size="5"> variable </font></a> 'a' by itself, with no numbers beside it.:on_paper/E2.png

dorminTable1_C1R2:a::Now, you would write <font color="#00FF00" face="Times New Roman" size="5"> a </font> on the left-hand side, because 3a divided by 3 or 3a/3 results in 'a'. The symbol '/' means division.:correct:on_paper/E24.png
dorminTable2_C1R2:5/3:: In this step, you would write <font color="#00FF00" face="Times New Roman" size="5"> 5/3 </font> on the right-hand side, because 5 divided by 3 gives you 5/3. There is no need to convert fraction to decimal in this application.:correct:on_paper/E25.png

title: 3y+4=10
text: You need to eliminate the constant term '+4' and the coefficient '3'. To eliminate '+4' you would subtract 4 from both sides. This would give you '3x' on the left hand side. Then to eliminate 3, you would divide both sides by 3. Remember, you need to apply an arithmetic operators (i.e., add, subtract, multiply, divide) to both sides to maintain the quality of the equation.
shortDescription:This is a two-step equation because you need to manipulate the equation twice to get the <a href="curriculum.html#KeyTerms" title="A letter in an equation is called the variable."><font color="#00F7FF" face="Times New Roman" size="5"> variable </font></a> 'y' by itself, with no numbers beside it on one side of the equal sign.:on_paper/E3.png

title:-4=-10+2x
text:  You need to eliminate the constant term -10, and the coefficient 2. So, first you would add 10, to eliminate '-10' from both sides. This would give you 6 on the left hand side and '2x' on the right hand side. Then, to eliminate 2, you would divide both sides by 2.

dorminTable1_C1R2:6::Now, you would write <font color="#00FF00" face="Times New Roman" size="5"> 6</font> on the left-hand side, because adding 10 to -4 means -4+10 which gives you 6.:correct:on_paper/E44.png

title: 5x+6 = 3x+4
text: Start by subtracting 6 from both sides, to eliminate term 6 from the right-hand side. Then you should subtract 3x to gather your variable terms on the left-hand side. Finally, to get x by itself you need to divide by 2.
shortDescription: This equation has variables on both sides. It is also three-step equation because you need to manipulate the equation three times to get the <a href="curriculum.html#KeyTerms" title="A letter in an equation is called the variable."><font color="#00F7FF" face="Times New Roman" size="5"> variable </font></a> 'x' by itself, with no numbers beside it on one side of the equal sign.:on_paper/E5.png

dorminTable1_C1R2:5x::Now you would type <font color="#00FF00" face="Times New Roman" size="5">5x</font> on the left-hand side, because subtracting 6  from 5x+6 gives you 5x+6-6 which results in 5x.:correct:on_paper/E54.png
dorminTable2_C1R2:3x-2::In this step, you will type <font color="#00FF00" face="Times New Roman" size="5">3x-2</font> on the right-hand side, because subtracting 6 from 3x+4 gives you 3x+4-6 which results in 3x-2.:correct:on_paper/E55.png

dorminTable2_C1R3:-2:: Now you would type <font color="#00FF00" face="Times New Roman" size="5">-2</font> on the right-hand side, because subtracting 3x from 3x-2 gives you 3x-2-3x or -2. Notice how subtracting 3x only affects the variable term (3x) since they are <a href="curriculum.html#KeyTerms" title="Two variable terms are like terms with each other if they have the same letter."><font color="#00F7FF" face="Times New Roman" size="5"> like terms </font></a>:correct:on_paper/E58.png

dorminTable2_C1R2:9-y::In this step, you type <font color="#00FF00" face="Times New Roman" size="5">9-y</font> on the right-hand side, because adding 3 to 6-y or 6-y+3 gives you 9-y.
