	 <phrase>But in the &lt;font color="blue"&gt;past&lt;/font&gt;, for &lt;font color="blue"&gt;"%prev_problem%"&lt;/font&gt;, the next step was to click the &lt;font color="blue"&gt;"problem is solved"&lt;/font&gt; button, and it was acknowledged as correct. To me, &lt;font color="red"&gt;"%current_problem%"&lt;/font&gt; looks the same, but you said it is not. Why is the problem not solved yet?</phrase>
