Okay. Maybe Mr. Williams has a suggestion for what we should be working on? <MT>
Okay. Should we ask Mr. Williams what kind of problem we should work on? <MT>

STEP_CORRECT
Yes, based on the previous steps, <i> would be correct here.
Yes, <i> would be correct here.
Yes, putting <i> <s> seems reasonable to me.
Yes, I don't see any reason why you shouldn't use <i> <s>.

STEP_INCORRECT
No, <i> would not be the correct thing to do here right now.
No, I don't think putting <i> <s> is the best move right now.
No, at this point in the problem, it would not be correct to put <i> here.

CHECK_ANSWER
Okay, then, let's see if the solution is correct.   I'd plug <i> in for <o> in the original equation, which is <s>.
Now to check if the answer is right, I would plug <i> in for <o> in the original problem, <s>.

NO_VAR_VALUE_CHECK_ANS
Oh, wait!  I can't find a number to plug in for the variable!

PLUG_IN
It looks like <s> I have <i>, so that becomes <o>.<A0>
Okay, <s> is <i>, which makes it <o>.<A0>
Then <i> is <s> so that becomes <o>.<A2>
<i> <s> becomes <o>.
And <s> <i> makes <o>.<A2>
<i> <s> makes <o>.
And <s> <i> becomes <o>.<A2>

NO_VAR_TO_PLUG
Then <s> I have <o>.
And <s> I have <o>. <A2>
<o> is <s>.

BALANCE_CHECK_ANSWER
Okay, <i> and <o> are equal, so I think that is the correct answer.
<i> and <o> are equal, so that means the problem should be right.
<i> and <o> are balanced, so I think the answer is right.
And <i> is equal to <o>, so I think the answer is right.
<i> and <o> are equal.
Oh, good! <i> and <o> are balanced!
It looks right! <i> and <o> are the same!

NO_BALANCE_CHECK_ANSWER
Oh, <i> and <o> are not equal.
But <i> and <o> are not equal.
Oh, wait! <i> and <o> don't balance!
Oh, wait! <i> and <o> aren't equal!

VERIFY_WRONG
I think the answer is wrong.  Let's restart the problem and try again.
I don't think the answer is right.  I wonder what I did wrong!  I think we should restart the problem.
I think I must have made a mistake.  Let's restart the problem and try again.
I think I must have made a mistake.  I wonder what I did wrong!  I think we should restart the problem.
I don't think the answer is right.  I'd like to restart the problem.
I think I must have made a mistake.  I'd like to restart the problem.
