title:2/5 + 4/15
shortDescription: This is a fraction addition problem with fractions having different denominators, but one of them is a multiple of the other. Use the buttons bellow to view the solution!
dorminTable1_C1R1:2:This is the numerator of the first fraction.::
dorminTable1_C1R2:5:This is the denominator of the first fraction.::
dorminTable2_C1R1:4:This is the numerator of the second fraction.::
dorminTable2_C1R2:15:This is the denominator of the second fraction.::
commComboBox2:Add::correct:bla
commTextField:3::correct:bla bla
dorminTable3_C1R2:15::correct:The denominator here is the least common multiple of the two denominators, 3 and 15, which is 15.
dorminTable3_C1R1:6::correct:Now, the denominator is 15, which is 3 times as big as 5.  Therefore, you need to multiply the original numerator (2) by 3. The new numerator is 6. 
dorminTable4_C1R2:15::correct:The denominator here is the least common multiple of the denominators, i.e. 15.
dorminTable4_C1R1:4::correct: Now, the denominator is 15, which is 1 times as big as 15.  Therefore, you need to multiply the original numerator (4) by 1. The new numerator remains 4.
dorminTable5_C1R1:10::correct:Both fractions now have the denominators, so you need to add their numerators. Adding 6 and 4 gives 10.
dorminTable5_C1R2:15::correct:The denominator of the sum of two fractions with the same denominators is the same,  i.e. 15.
done:-1: The problem is solved! The answer is 10/15.:correct: The result is a proper fraction, so the problem is solved! The answer is 10/15.

title:3/10 + 7/5
shortDescription: Here you add two fractions with different denominators. Notice that one denominator (10) is a multiple of the other (5). Use the buttons bellow to view the solution!
dorminTable1_C1R1:3:This is the numerator of the first fraction.:.:.
dorminTable1_C1R2:10:This is the denominator of the second fraction.I wonder what is the least common multiple of the denominators.:.:.
dorminTable2_C1R1:7:This is the numerator of the first fraction.:.:.
dorminTable2_C1R2:5:This is the denominator of the second fraction.I wonder what is the least common multiple of the denominators.:.:.
dorminTable3_C1R2:10::correct:The denominator here is the least common multiple of the two denominators, 10 and 5, which is 10.
dorminTable3_C1R1:3::correct: Now, the denominator is 10, which is 1 times as big as 10.  Therefore, you need to multiply the original numerator (3) by 1. The new numerator is 3. 
dorminTable4_C1R2:10::correct:The denominator here is the least common multiple of the two denominators, which is 10.
dorminTable4_C1R1:14::correct: Now, the denominator is 10, which is 2 times as big as 5.  Therefore, you need to multiply the original numerator (7) by 2. The new numerator is 14. 
dorminTable5_C1R1:17::correct: Both fractions now have the same denominator, so you need to add their numerators. Adding 3 and 14 gives 17.
dorminTable5_C1R2:10::correct:The denominator is the least common multiple of the denominators, i.e. 10.
commTextField:1::correct:We ended up with an improper fraction (17/10), so we must convert it into a mixed fraction.  There is only 1 10 in 17, so the whole number of the mixed fraction 1.
dorminTable6_C1R2:10::correct:Making a mixed number fraction will not change the denominator, so the denominator of the mixed number fraction is 10.
dorminTable6_C1R1:7::correct:If you remove 1 10 from 17, there will be 7 left. So the numerator of the complex number fraction is 7.
done:-1: The problem is solved! The answer is 1 7/10.:correct: The problem is solved! The answer is 1 7/10.

dorminTable3_C1R2:30::correct:The denominator here is the least common multiple of the two denominators, 5 and 6, which is 30.
dorminTable3_C1R1:12::correct:Now, the denominator is 30, which is 6 times as big as 5.  Therefore, you need to multiply the original numerator (2) by 6. The new numerator is 12.
dorminTable4_C1R2:30::correct:The denominator here is the least common multiple of the two denominators, 5 and 6, which is 30.
dorminTable4_C1R1:15::correct:Now, the denominator is 30, which is 5 times as big as 6.  Therefore, you need to multiply the original numerator (3) by 5. The new numerator is 15.
dorminTable5_C1R1:27::correct:Both fractions now the same denominator, so you need to add their numerators. Adding 12 and 15 gives 27.
dorminTable5_C1R2:30::correct:The denominator here is the least common multiple of the denominators, i.e. 30.
done:-1: The problem is solved! The answer is 26/30.:correct: The result is a proper fraction so the problem is solved! The answer is 27/30.

dorminTable3_C1R1:12::correct:Now, the denominator is 6, which is 3 times as big as 2.  Therefore, you need to multiply the original numerator (4) by 3. The new numerator is 12.
dorminTable4_C1R2:6::correct:The denominator here is the least common multiple of the two denominators, 2 and 3, which is 6.
dorminTable4_C1R1:10::correct:Now, the denominator is 6, which is 2 times as big as 3.  Therefore, you need to multiply the original numerator (5) by 2. The new numerator is 10.
dorminTable5_C1R1:22::correct:Both fractions now the same denominator, so you need to add their numerators. Adding 12 and 10 gives 22.
dorminTable5_C1R2:6::correct:The denominator here is the least common multiple of the two denominators, which is 6.
commTextField:3::correct:We ended up with an improper fraction (22/6), so we must convert it into a mixed fraction.  There are 3 6’s in 22, so the whole number of the mixed fraction 3.
dorminTable6_C1R2:6::correct:Making a mixed number fraction will not change the denominator, so the denominator of the mixed number fraction is 6.
dorminTable6_C1R1:4::correct:If you remove 3 6’s from 22, there will be 4 left. So the numerator of the complex number fraction is 4.
