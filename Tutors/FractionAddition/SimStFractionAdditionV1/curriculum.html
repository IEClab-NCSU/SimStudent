<h2 style="margin:4px"> Key Terms </h2>
<p style="margin:2px;"> Important words and definitions:
<ul>
<li><b>Numerator</b>: A numerator is the top number of a fraction.  For example, the numerator of the fraction 1/2 is 1. The numerator of the fraction 7/4 is 7 
<li><b>Denominator</b>: A denominator is the bottom number of a fraction. For example, the denominator of the fraction 1/2  is 2.  The denominator of the fraction 7/4 is 4.  
	
<li><b>Types of Fractions</b>: There are three types of fractions: 
<ul>
<li><b>Proper Fractions</b>: A proper fraction has a numerator smaller than a denominator.</li>
	<ul>
	<li> Examples of proper fractions: 8/12, 6/9, 1/3. </li>
	</ul>
<li><b>Improper Fractions</b>: An improper fraction has a numerator greater than or equal to a denominator. </li>
	<ul>
	<li> Examples of improper fractions:  5/3, 11/4, 9/5, 6/6</li>
	</ul>
<li><b>Mixed number Fractions</b>: A mixed number fraction is a combination of a whole number and a proper fraction.</li>
	<ul>
	<li> Examples of mixed number fractions: 1 2/3, 3 1/5, 2 4/9</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
 </li>

<li><b>Simplifying fractions</b> 
<ul>
<li>2/3 is equivalent to 4/6.  2/3 is also equal to 6/9.  Why? </li>
	<ul>
	<li> You can multiply both a numerator and a denominator with the same number, and still get the same fraction. </li>
	</ul>
<li>This means that 6/9 is equal to 2/3.   We say that 6/9 can be simplified to 2/3. </li>
	<ul>
	<li> To simplify a fraction, you can divide both a numerator and a denominator by the same number. 
	</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul></li>


<li><b>Converting fractions</b> 
<ul>
<li>A mixed number fraction can be converted into an improper fraction. </li>
	<ul>
	<li> For example, think about 2 ⅗, which is 2 and ⅗.  Because 2 is 10/5, 2 and 3/5 is equal to 10/5 and 3/5.  10/5 and 3/5 is equal to 13/5. </li>
	<li>Therefore, 2 2/5 is equal to 13/5.</li>
	</ul>
<li>An improper fraction can be converted into a mixed number fraction. </li>
	<ul>
	<li>   For example, 8/3 is 6/3 and 2/3.   6/3 is 2.  Therefore, 8/3 is 2 2/3. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul</li>

<li><b>Multiple</b>:  Numbers that you can make by multiplying an original number.
<ul>
<li>For example, multiple of 3 are 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, …</li>
<li>The multiple of 5 are 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ...</li>
</ul>
</li>


<li><b>Least Common Multiple</b>: The least common multiple of two numbers is smallest multiple that they have in common.
<ul>
<li>The multiple of 4 are 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 28…</li>
<li>The multiple of 6 are 6, 12, 18, 24, 30…</li>
<li>Therefore, the least common multiple of 4 and 6 is 12</li>
</ul>
</li>


<li><b>Reduction to Common Denominator</b>: To add fractions with different denominators, you need to reduce denominators.
<ul>
<li>To add 1/3 and ½, you need to reduce the denominators 3 and 2.</li>
<li>The least common multiple of 3 and 2 is 6.  So, convert 1/3 and ½ into fractions that have 6 as its denominator. </li>
<li>1/3 is equal to 2/6</li>
<li>1/2 is equal to 3/6</li>
<li>Therefore, 1/3 + 1/2 = 2/6 + 3/6, which is 5/6.</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>

	
</ul>

<h2 style="margin:4px"> Example Solutions</h2>
<p style="margin:2px;"> To add fractions with the same denominator, e.g., 2/5 + 1/5, you simply add the numerators, 2 and 1. Write the sum (which is 3 in this case) over the common denominator (which is 5).   The answer for this example is 3/5. </p>

<ul style="list-style-type: none;"><li>In summary, 2/5 + 1/5 = 3/5.  The answer is 3/5.</li></ul>


<p style="margin:2px;">Let’s think about another example: 1/6 + 3/6</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: none;"><li>
Because two fractions have the same denominator (which is 6), you can simply add numerators (1 and 3).  
1/6 + 3/6 = 4/6
<br><br>
Are we done?  Not yet!!
<br><br>
Both 4 and 6 can be divided by 2.  This means that 4/6 can be simplified.  
4 ÷ 2 = 2 and  6 ÷ 2 = 3.
Therefore, 4/6 = 2/3. 
<br><br>
In summary, 1/6 + 3/6 = 4/6 = 2/3.  The answer is 2/3.

</li></ul>


<p style="margin:2px;">Lets think about another example: 5/8+ 6/8</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: none;"><li>

Because two fractions have the same denominator (which is 8), to add them, you first add the numerator (which is 11) and place it above the same denominator (which is 8). 
5/8 + 6/8 = 11/8 
<br><br>
Are we done? Not yet!! 
<br><br>
Because the numerator is larger than the denominator, this fraction is an improper fraction. The improper fraction must be converted into a mixed number fraction. 
<br><br>
11/8 is equal to 8/8 and 3/8.  8/8 is equal to 1.  Therefore, 11/8 is equal to 1 and ⅜, which is 1 ⅜.
<br><br>
In summary, ⅝ + 6/8 = 11/8 = 1 ⅜.   The answer is 1 3/8.
</li></ul>


<p style="margin:2px;">An example of fraction addition with different denominators.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: none;"><li>
Let’s do 3/4 + 5/6
First, you need to reduce denominators.  The least common multiple of 4 and 6 is 12.
<br><br>
3/4 = 9/12
5/6 = 10/12
<br><br>
Therefore, 3/4 + 5/6 is equal to 9/12 = 10/12, which is 19/12.
<br><br>
Because 19/12 is an improper fraction, you need to convert it into a mixed number fraction. 
<br><br>
19/12 = 1 7/12
<br><br>
In sum, 3/4 + 5/6 = 9/12 + 10/12 = 19/12 = 1 7/12.  The answer is 1 7/12
</li></ul>

<h2 style="margin:4px;">Skills</h2>
<p style="margin:2px;">In this unit you will learn to:</p>
<ul>

<li><b>Add fractions with same denominator</b>:  To add fractions with the same denominators, you place the sum of the numerators over the common denominator. 
	<ul>
	<li>3/4 + 5/4 = 8/4</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li><b>Convert an improper fraction into a mixed number fraction </b>: An improper fraction can be converted into a mixed number fraction. The whole number of the mixed number is the quotient of the proper fraction, the numerator is the remainder and the denominator is the same. 
	<ul>
	<li>7/3 is converted into the mixed number fraction 2 ⅓. The whole number shows how many 3’s you have in 7 (which is 2), the numerator is what you have left if you subtract two 3’s from 7 (which is 1) and the denominator is the same (4).</li>	
	</ul>
</li>

<li><b>Find the least common multiple</b>: To add fractions with different denominators, you need to find the least common multiple of the denominators. 
	<ul>
	<li>For 1/5 + 3/6, you first need to find the least common multiple of 5 and 6, which is 30</li>
	</ul>
</li>

   






<li><b>Reduce denominators</b>:  To add fractions with different denominators, you need to reduce the denominators into the least common multiple.
	<ul>
	<li>For 2/9 + 3/5, you need to find the least common multiple of 9 and 5, which is 45.</li>
	<ul>
	<li>The fraction 2/9 becomes 10/45.</li>
	<li>The fraction 3/5 becomes 27/45.</li>
	</ul>
	</ul>
</li>
