mistakeExplanations
text:But before, (E).  Why doesn't (I) work now?
.
text:But before, (E).  So, I thought (I) would work here.  Why is this different?

problemChoiceExplanations
text:Why did you choose (P) for the problem?
:Because it is an easier problem.
:Because it is a more challenging problem.
:Because I want to see if you can do it.
:Because you got a problem like it wrong before.
:Because I want you to get more practice on this type of problem.
.
text:What will doing the problem (P) help me learn?
:How to deal with more terms.
:How to deal with coefficients.
:How to deal with variables on both sides.
:How to use inverse operations.
:How to deal with negatives.
:How to deal with terms in different places.

hintExplanations
text:What will doing (I) accomplish?
!typein,add;subtract:It will get the variables to the same side.
!typein,add;subtract:It will get the constants to the same side.
!typein,multiply;divide:It will get the variable by itself.
!typein,multiply;divide:It gets rid of the division.
!typein,distribute;clt:It will get rid of the parentheses.
!typein,distribute;clt:It will move the variable terms together.
!typein,distribute;clt:It will move the constant terms together.
done:We can stop working on the problem.
:It cancels out the term (F).
:It simplifies the equation.
.
text:What is it about (P) that made you know to (O)?
!typein,add;subtract:The term (F) is positive.
!typein,add;subtract:The term (F) is negative.
!typein,add;subtract:There are variables on both sides of the equation.
!typein,add;subtract:There are constants on both sides of the equation.
!typein,multiply;divide:The variable term <get-var-term (F)> has a coefficient (<coefficient (F)>).
!typein,multiply;divide:The equation has division in it.
!typein,multiply;divide:There are no extra terms left to cancel out.
!typein,distribute;clt:The equation has parentheses in it.
!typein,distribute;clt:There is more than one variable term on one side.
!typein,distribute;clt:There is more than one constant term on one side.
!typein,distribute;clt:The equation has multiplication in it.
done:The only variable is by itself.
done:The variable has no coefficient.
:There is more than one term in part of the equation.
.
text:How did you know to use <get-operand "(I)">?
!typein,add;subtract:Because <get-var-term (F)> is a variable term.
!typein,add;subtract:Because <get-const-term (F)> is a constant term.
!typein,multiply;divide:Because <coefficient (F)> is the coefficient of the variable term <get-var-term (F)>.
!typein,multiply;divide:Because <get-operand "(I)"> is the denominator of the division.
!typein,distribute;clt:That part of the equation has parentheses.
!typein,distribute;clt:That part of the equation has multiplication.
!typein,distribute;clt:That side of the equation has more than one variable term.
!typein,distribute;clt:That side of the equation has more than one constant term.
done:The only variable is by itself.
done:The variable has no coefficient.
!done:Because <get-const-term <get-operand "(I)">> is right next to the variable.
!done:Because <get-operand "(I)"> is the opposite of one of the terms.
!done:Because (F) is on the same side with a different type of term.
