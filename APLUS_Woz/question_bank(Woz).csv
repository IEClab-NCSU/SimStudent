Pre,Problem identification / problem representational questions (new problem type),"; Can you explain what this equation says?
;	Can you explain what is happening in this equation?
;	This is new to me. What do I need to know about this equation before I start solving this?
;	I have never solved this type of equation before. Can you explain more on this equation?
;	I have never seen this type of equation before. Can you explain the basic characteristics of these types of equation?
;	This equation does not look exactly like any of the equations that we have solved so far. Can you elaborate more on this equation?
;	I have never seen this type of equation before. Can you explain the basic differences of this type of equation with the ones that we have solved before?
;	Can you point out the differences of this equation with the ones that we have solved so far?
;	Would you help me visualize what this equation represents?
;	I have seen equations that has variable term on one side and constants on the other. We just performed one action to solve such equations. Can you explain the difference between those equations and the current one?; I have seen equations that has variable and constant on one side and another constant on the other. But this equation has variables on both sides. How does that affect our way of solving equations?; I have trouble understanding the meaning of this equation. Can you explain this equation in plain english to me?"
Pre,Problem identification / problem representational questions (old problem type),";	I feel like we have solved similar equations like this one. Do we follow any different approach to solve this equation or we stick to our earlier plan?
;	It seems like I have solved such equations before. Is there any exception in this equation that might affect the way I am planning to solve it?
;	I have seen this type of equations earlier where the equation had variable and constant on one side and another constant. We performed two actions in order to solve such problems. Do we do the same here or follow any different approach to solve this equation? 
; I have seen the variable term on the LHS of the equal sign all the time. In this problem we have variable term on the RHS. Does this make them two different types of equation?"
Pre,Goal clarification,"; How do I know if the equation is solved?
; What does solving equation mean?; How do I verify that my step is right?; Do you know any trick to verify that the step is correct?; I have seen that when ""x"" is on the LHS, you ask me to click the ""problem is solved"" button. This time ""x"" is in the RHS. Why did you ask me to click the ""problem is solved"" button?"
During,Plan retrieval,";	What will be your strategy to solve this equation?
;	How long do I need to manipulate this equation to reach to its solution?
;	What do I have to do to the things in the LHS to just have the variable term on the LHS?;What do I have to do to the things in the RHS to just have the variable term on the RHS?
;	How can we end up with just the variable term in one side of the equal sign?
;	What is the key to solve this type of equation?
;	We have not solved any equations in which variable appears on the both sides but I know how to solve equations that have variable only on one side. So, can we do something to eliminate variable from one side?
;	I can solve equations that have variable on one side and constant on the other. Do you know any way to turn this equation into that form?;How do you know that performing just one step will be enough to solve this equation?"
During,Plan Clarification,"; Can you elaborate more on those equation types for which we can say that performing just one step will lead us towards the goal?
; In this equation we have ""3x = 6"" and we perform ""divide 3"" to solve this equation. Would we have done the same if we had equation ""6 = 3x""? ;  Can we flip the two sides of an equation without changing the signs of the terms?;	How do we know that the equation is still balanced even after the transformations?
;	How would I know that my equation is still correct after performing the transformation action?"
During,Summarization/Verification of plan,";	I got it. We are working on a simple equation and by simple we mean, equations that has variable term on one side and constants on the other. We only need to perform one action in order to solve that equation. Did I get that right?
;	We are working on equations that has variable term and some number that is added/subtracted from it on one side and constants on the other. We will need to perform two actions in order to solve that equation. Did I get that right?
;	For equations with variables on both sides, we need to get rid of variable from one side and then we can solve it like the earlier ones. Did I get that right?"
During,Query on what to do next,";What to do next?
;What are we going to do first?
;What should I write in the ""LHS/RHS""?
;Can you show me how to perform ""transformation"" correctly?; What will be our next step?; I do not know how to perform ""transformation"". Can you show me how?; What is going to be our next step?; What would be a good problem to do next? "
During,Subgoal retrieval,";	What is your motivation behind doing that?
;	Can you explain what goal will we achieve by Òadd 9Ó in this equation?
;	Do we always ""add"" to eliminate something?
;	How Òdivide -4Ó will help us solve the equation?
;	How does ""getting rid of 4 from LHS"" help us solve this equation?
;	Which part of the equation made you know that Òadd 9Ó should be applied in this state?"
During,Verification on being subgoal,";	How does this action make the equation easier?; Does this step makes our equation look simpler than it was before? "
During,generalize action,";	Do we always write ""+3"" at the end of the both sides when we perform the action ""add 3""? 
;	Does the order of where we write ""+3"" in the equation matter in such case?
;	Can you summarize this action as a rule so that I can apply that rule for other similar equations at this state?; ""Current scene: 5x+3 = 10"" Why did you choose to ""subtract"" with ""3"" but not with ""5"" or ""10""?; I see that current equation has a ""number multiplied"" to the variable term and also another ""number added"" to it. But why did you choose ""divide"" operation in particular?; ""Current scene: 5x+3 = 10"" Why did you perform ""subtract 3"" but not ""subtract -3?""; ""Current Scene: 5x + 5 = 5"" I am confused. Why did you choose to ""divide 5""?Is it because of the ""5"" in the ""RHS""?; 
;	I see. Can you explain how do we get ""<<outcome>> in the LHS"" after applying ""<<transformation>>"" on it?
;	Can you explain how do we get ""<<outcome>>""?"
During,Summarization of action and subgoal,
During,Justification of similarity or dissimilarity on contrasting case,"; ""Current scene: 3x+4 = 15 performed subtract 4 and wrote 3x = 15"" Something is wrong here. In the beginning when we had ""3x plus 4 equals to 15"". Now after transformation ""subtract 4"", we have ""3x equals to 15"". It does not make any sense. Can you explain what is wrong here? Or how can we make things right? Or Can you clarify my confusion?
;	""Incorrect transformation entered by tutor (-10 +8 )"" I think it should be Ò-2Ó. From my textbook I have learnt that if we start at ""negative 10"" in number line and move ""8 bars to the positive directions"" of number line, it gives me a negative 2 which means ""-10+8"" will give us ""-2"". Did I get that part right?  
;	Earlier, when we solved ""4x = 15"", I did ""divide 4"" since ""4"" is the number ""multiplied"" with ""x"". Now, we have ""x/4 = 15"". Why can not I ""divide"" now?
;	Earlier performed ""divide"" operation first but now I am performing ""subtract"". How do I know what to do first?
;	""Current : Ð 12 = 2x Ð 15 "" I am confused because I thought we should apply ""add 12"" here since earlier when we had ""3x Ð 12 = 3"", I was taught to ""add 12"" on both sides because ""LHS has -12"". Can you explain why can not we apply ""add 12"" now?
;	""Current 2x + 4 = 5  and subtract 5Ó Earlier when we had ""2x Ð 4 = 5"", we did ""add 4"" in order to eliminate ""4 from LHS"" and it helped us to reach our goal. Can you explain why can not we eliminate ""4 from LHS"" similarly? 
;	""Current 2x -9 = 3x + 8 and add 9"" Earlier in the quiz problem where I had ""2x + 9 = 3x + 8"" and I performed Òadd 9Ó, I got incorrect answer. I am taught that if LHS has a number with variable term, I should add that number. Then why was I wrong in the quiz? ;// KB and tutor stated action coincides but has defect in the production rule.; ""Current scene: -3x+3 = 9"" Earlier, when we had ""3x+3=9"", I did ""divide 3"" since ""x"" had ""3"" as its coefficient and we wanted to eliminate ""3"" to isolate ""x"". Also in this case, ""x"" has ""3"" as its coefficient. Then why are we ""dividing -3"" instead of ""divide 3""?; I remember in the past, when we had ""x+1=3"", I did transformation ""subtract 1"". Now I see ""x-1=3"". So I thought ""subtract 1"" would work here. Why is this different?
	"
During,Query prompt for better alternative goal/actions by focusing alternative parts of the problem,";	""Current: 2x + 4 = 5 divide 2Ó I thought I should add 4 here because I was taught that if ""LHS"" has number along with variable term, we always get rid of that number. Why did you choose ""divide 2"" instead of ""add 4""?
;	""Current: 2x + 4 = 5 subtract 5Ó Why did you focus on ""5"" here? Why did not we try to eliminate ""4 from LHS"" or ""2 from LHS""? How can you be certain that Òsubtract 5Ó will be the correct action to do here?; Can we focus on some other part of the equation in order to know our next action?; "
During,Merging similar production rules,";	""Current scene: 2x +12 = 19."" I know I can apply ""subtract 12"" here. However, in my textbook, I have seen that ""add -12"" actually gives us the same effect as ""subtract 12"". Can you verify if this is correct or not?; ""Current scene: 2x Ð 12 = 16"" I think ""divide 2"" can also be applied here. Can you explain why do you prefer to apply ""add 12"" for this case instead of ""divide 2""?; ""Current scene: 2x-3 = 3x+5"" Do you think we can also apply ""subtract 5"" instead of ""add 3"" here?"
During,Prompt to provide similar examples and analysis of different examples in the past,";	Can you present some other examples for which ""subtract 12"" can be applied?
;	What are the similarities in all of these equations that made you know that we can apply   ""subtract 12"" here?
;	Earlier, during my quiz, I applied ""subtract 12 on 12=4x-12"" but I got incorrect remarks for that. Can you explain why? "
During,Query on different parts of the action,";	""Current Scenario: 2x Ð 12 = 16 , add 12 "" I have always seen that ""add"" comes with a positive number like ""add 12, add 13"". Do we always need a positive number to use the add operation?; ""Current Scenario:  2x Ð 12 = 16 , add 12"" If I had written the equation like ""-12+2x = 16"", should I still be performing ""add 12"" on it?; ""Current Scenario: 2x Ð 12 = 16 , add 12"" I am performing ""add 12"" because of the number ""12"" in the LHS. If I had an equation like 2x+12 = 16, should I still be performing ""add 12"" on it?; Why did we choose to ""add"" but not ""subtract"" in this scenario? ; Why did we choose to ""divide"" but not ""multiply"" in this scenario?; ""Current scene: 2x Ð 12 = 16"" I think ""divide 2"" can also be applied here. Can you explain why do you prefer to apply ""add 12"" for this case instead of ""divide 2""?"
During,Simplification to known problem shape,";	""Current Scenario: 7r Ð 8 = 55"" This equation does not look like any of the equations that we already know how to solve. But I can solve equations that has variable term on one side and constant on the other. Do you know how to eliminate ""8"" from ""LHS""?
;	""Current scenario: x+7 = 0"" I know that if there is an isolated variable term in the LHS, then we can say the equation is solved. What transformation can leave ""x"" isolated on the ""LHS""? ; ""Current scenario: 3x+5 = 2x-6"", I know how to solve equations like ""3x+5 = -6"" but we have an additional ""2x"" in the ""RHS"" here. Do you know how can we transform the current equation to have one variable term just on one side?"
During,validation on why Tutee KB agrees with tutor's action / focus on differences ,"; ""Current Scene: -15 = 2x Ð 15"" Earlier, when we had ""2x Ð 15 = 9"", I did ""add 15"" because ""-15"" was in the ""LHS"". Are we going to perform ""add 15"" this time because ""-15"" is in the LHS? ; ""Current scene: -3x+3 = 9"" Earlier, when we had ""3x+3=9"", I did ""divide 3"" since ""x"" had ""3"" as its coefficient and we wanted to eliminate ""3"" to isolate ""x"". I see that we are doing the same operation here even though we have ""-3x"" in this equation. Are we missing something here?; ""Current scene: x-1 = 3"" Earlier, when we had ""x+1=3"", I did ""subtract 1"" to eliminate ""+1"" from ""LHS"" and isolate ""x"". This time we have ""x-1"". Why are we applying the same transformation to eliminate ""-1"" from the LHS?; ""Current scene: x-1 = 3"" Earlier, when we had ""x+1=3"", I did ""subtract 1"" because ""x"" had ""1 added"" with it. This time ""1 is not added with x"". Shouldn't we apply a different transformation here? ; ""Current scenario: 3x+5 = 2x-6"", Earlier when we had ""3x+5 = 6"", I did ""divide 3"". But this time we have ""2x"" in the ""RHS"". Do we need a different transformation here because of this difference?
