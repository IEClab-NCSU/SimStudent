"you need to subtract 2 because you need to get rid of it so you could have 3v alone.
",R2
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"i think you have to figure out what v equals
",R0
"in order to find what v equals, you have to divide by 3 on both sides
",R0
"so you would do 3v divided by 3 and 5 divided by 3 and you should get what v equals
",R2
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"it's correct
",R0
"you have to add 6 onto -6
",R0
"since -6 is negative you want to cancel it out and add 6 in order to get -4y alone
",R2
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"you would have to divide by -4 since -4y is a negative
",R2
"yes because 3 is positive and -4 is negative and you divide by what that number is
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes because now you know that -4 equals y
",R2
"you did not finish the equation when you pressed problem is solved
",R1
"you forgot the last step
",R1
"yes
",R0
"yes you would have to subtract 2 since 2 is positive in the equation
",R2
"since 2 is positive in the equation you need to cancel it out to get -5y alone
",R2
"so yes subtract 2 
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes that is correct. now you know that -2 equals y
",R2
"on the first question, you forgot the last step 
",R1
"yes 
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"you have to divide by -2 in order to get n alone so you could see what it equals
",R2
"and dont forget to divide 9 by -2 too
",R0
"yes
",R0
"you would have to put 9/-2 because 9 is positive and your dividng it by -2
",R2
"yes
",R0
"i would just write it 9/-2
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"that is correct
",R0
"yes
",R0
"instead of dividing -9 you should subtract 7 off of 7c
",R1
"yes 
",R0
"when you subtract 7c from 7cit will cancel it out and you would be left with -18=-9c and then continue solving the problem
",R2
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes since you need to get c alone so you could see what it equals, you'd need to divide -16
",R2
"no because you're dividing -18 by -16 and -16c by -16
",R2
"so instead of 9/8 it would be -18/-16
",R1
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes you are correct
",R0

"3=x+12
",R0
"yes sir
",R0
"first subtract 12 
",R0
"divide 3 first instead of subtracting 12
",R0
"yes
",R0
"no, 3 divided by 3 is 0 so you only remain with x
",R2
"no anything divided by itself is 0
",R2
"first you need to get x by itself before moving onto the next step
",R2
"i fixed it for you
",R0
"do you know what to do next?
",R0
"let's replace it with x
",R0
"you did it, let's move on to the next step
",R0
"sure, let's try this again
",R0
"first we will subtract 12
",R0
"on the right side
",R0
"now we subtract 12 from the left
",R0
"sure
",R0
"yes
",R0
"i think so
",R0
"ok
",R0
"i'll give you one more problem then i'll quiz you 
",R0
"s-3=7
",R0
"no problem
",R0
"great job
",R0
"do you know what comes next?
",R0
"how did you get that?
",R0
"i dont think so
",R0
"sure
",R0
"wait this is wrong
",R1
"irst step is to add 3 to -3
",R0
"great so now you end up with s by itself. Now add 3 to 7
",R0
"that is because you do the inverse opperation 
",R0
"for example, +3 should be -3
",R0
"yes
",R0
"now add 3 to 7
",R0
"yes
",R0
"problem solved
",R0
"now i'll quiz you
",R0
"good luck :)
",R0
"i saw what you did wrong, let's work on it
",R0
"15=3x
",R0
"solve
",R0
"think of the problem liked it's reversed.now it is 3x = 15
",R0
"it doesn't make a difference if you switch the 2 right now
",R0
"correct
",R0
"to perform the division, divide three from 3 first
",R0
"actually divide 3 from 15 first
",R1
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"problem solved
",R0
"let's retake your quiz
",R0
"12=4+4y
",R0
"solve.
",R0
"no first subtracy 4 from 4
",R0
"subtract*
",R0
"no subtract 4
",R0
"you were wrong because firs twe need to get rid of the 4 which we now have
",R2
"don't be sorry
",R0
"do you know what's next?
",R0
"yes good job
",R0
"yep
",R0
"not yet
",R0
"there is another step
",R0
"now do what i taught you earlier with the one step equations
",R0
"divide 4 from y
",R0
"then repeat the step on the LHS
",R0
"yes great job
",R0
"yes
",R0
"problem solved
",R0
"let's try another problem to see if you're gettin it
",R0
"12 =2-5y
",R0
"solve.
",R0
"yes
",R0
"no, subtract 2 from 2
",R0
"then subtract 2 from 12 afterwards
",R0
"yes
",R0
"sounds good
",R0
"perfect
",R0
"which  other step?
",R0
"because we still have another step left. we still have a number in front of the y
",R2
"yes
",R0
"great
",R0
"problem solved
",R0
"ready for your next quiz?
",R0
"sure
",R0
"12=5x+2
",R0
"solve.
",R0
"correct
",R0
"next step?
",R0
"yep
",R0
"one more step
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes!
",R0
"you know the stuff
",R0
"yes
",R0
"thanks you too
",R0
"yep
",R0
"want to try that quiz again
?",R0
"you did good, just be sure to click the problem is solved button
",R0
"one more problem then we'll quiz again
",R0
"10c-5=6
",R0
"no
",R0
"we know the first step is to get rid of the 5
",R2
"dont be sorry friend
",R0
"ok good
",R0
"now add 5 to 6
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yep
",R0
"i'm actually unsure
",R0
"ok good idea
",R0
"ok go ahead and solve the problem
",R0
"yep
",R0
"ok good
",R0
"now let's quiz. make sure to click the problem solved button this time
",R0
"it's ok, i know what you did wrong
",R0
"let's try this problem again
",R0
"10-6-4y
",R0
"solve and i'll correct you along the way
",R0
"first step?
",R0
"good
",R0
"you had originally gotten mixed up and said /10 instead of +6
",R2
"yes
",R0
"correct!
",R0
"yes
",R0
"mmhm
",R0
"yes
",R0
"nice! i think you just get confused during the tests. 
",R0
"let's retake it one last time.
",R0
"no youre not, be positive
",R0
"9r - 4 = 10 - 5r
",R0
"good luck.
",R0
"i agree
",R0
"first try -4 from the LHS
",R0
"why
",R0
"oops m ybad
",R1
"add 4 instead
",R0
"yes sir
",R0
"yep
",R0
"yes
",R0
"first let's get rid of the 14
",R0
14,R0
"so now what do you have?
",R0
"yes
",R0
"why
",R0
"let's start from the beginning 
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"perfect
",R0
"ok
",R0
"that was a hard question, let's try another
",R0
"2x - 6 = 4 + 3x
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yep
",R0
"here let's add the 6 to the 3
",R0
"wait you were right
",R1
"continue
",R0
"yep
",R0
"now subtract 3 from 3x
",R0
"ok
",R0
"i am not sure
",R0
"Hi mario
",R0
"your new problem is 11y - 7 = 12y + 9
",R0
"solve.
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"eneccccrdtkhlhddigikedkebvthffjhceeebbelgfdc
",R0
"now you divide 12
",R0
"let's start over
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"5c-8 = c + 6
",R0
"ok
",R0
"yes
",R0
"6 + 8
",R0
"eneccccrdtkhkllghjdigkcvrelgnktkkbbjndlicjlb
",R0
"yes
",R0
"lets start over
",R0
"first -5
",R0
"from 5c
",R0
"yes
",R0
"well we can get c by itself on both sides
",R2
"so what do you end up with?
",R0
"no
",R0
"it should be
",R0
"well we subtracted 5 from the LHS and since there is no cumber in front of the variable we subtracted it from the 6
",R2
"let's try again
",R0
"first add 8 to both sides
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"add c to both sides
",R0
"god question i am not sure 
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"divide on both sides
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"now divide on the RHS
",R0
"sorry, multiple 3 on the RHS
",R1
"it should be c
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"c + 7/3
",R0
"why
",R0
"no only multiply 3 on the RHS
",R0
"but we have nothing to on the LHS
",R2
"not yet
",R0
"now can you add 7/3?
",R0
"actually
",R0
"yes
",R0
"ok
",R0
"ok
",R0
"ok
",R0
"problem solved
",R0
"bye mario

"eneccccrdtkhguibfcccjcvngeebddknebhhhefedend
",R0
"What do you know so far?
",R0
"About linear equations
",R0
"When ever you have a plus sign in linear equations then you subtract and vice versa
",R2
"yes
",R0
"No Bob but nice try
",R0
"The whole goal of linear equations is to get the vaeiarable by itself
",R2
"do you know what a vairable is?
",R0
"sure i will do the first step of the problem
",R0
"subtract nine from itself so that you are one step further to getting a by itself
",R2
"both numbers that don't have a vaireable because what you do to one side you have to do to the other
",R2
"i know
",R0
"yes
",R0
"that is correct! good job bob
",R0
"What do we do next?
",R0
"no, Remember that the WHOLE goal is to get find out what the vairable is equal to.
",R2
"yes you have to divide 5 by itself and -2
",R0
"Not really it is just something that you almost always do to get rid of the number attached to the vairable.
",R2
"yes what is in the RHS?
",R0
Yes bob! and that is your answer. a=-2/5,R0
let's try the quiz again and see what you have learned,R0
"Normally what i do is handle the smaller nubmer first.
",R0
"Actaually bob i would add -4
",R0
"Because you normally cancel out which ever number is on the side of the vairable
",R2
"yes
",R0
"add 4
",R0
"do you know why we did that ?
",R0
"Because the goal is to get the vairable by itsefl on whcihever sied it is on so the goal is to move the numbers on the other side of the vairable
",R2
"yes
",R0
"i
",R0
"am
",R0
"no remember, we are adding 4 because we want do cancel negative 4 on the RHS
",R2
"that is correct nice job bob!
",R0
"yup
",R0
"so what do we do now?
",R0
"yes you can what does that leave you with?
",R0
"yes Bob that is correat!
",R0
"yes do you wan't the try the test again?
",R0
"yes
",R0
"okay but what happend with the first problem you got it right last time?
",R0
"Okay bob try this one
",R0
"Also don't think about the vairiable think about the number attacheced to the vairabele
",R2
"for instance look at a problem like this
",R0
"yup
",R0
"first get rid of the negative 4
",R2
"You know this bob what we do to one side we have to do to the other so try and cancel -4
",R2
"yes bob that is correct
",R0
"yes!
",R0
"yup!
",R0
"No, With devision you don't nead a negative to cancel a postive you need the same number
",R2
"yes bob
",R0
"that looks right bob
",R0
"then you are done with the problem Bob!
",R0
"do you need more practice or do you want to try the test?
",R0
"I think you could try the test
",R0
"Why did you do that Bob?
",R0
"What would help you be more confident bob?
",R0
"okay this time I will help you with this problem but then i wan't you to do it by yourself okay?
",R0
"your welcome
",R0
"Yes that is right it is wrong try againg
",R0
"yes bob!!
",R0
"Yes Bob!
",R0
"yup
",R0
"Yes Bob!
",R0
"yes you wwere right
",R0
"yup!
",R0
"now you are going to do this problem again without asking me any questions
",R0
"got it bob?
",R0
"solve it
",R0
"Bob i thinkg your ready!
",R0
"Yes Bob! i am wise
",R0
"okaynow we are going to learn a new equations
",R0
"First tell me what you would do first
",R0
"Yes bob but what are you going to do with the variables?
",R0
"okay sure
",R0
"YEs bob nice job
",R0
"yup
",R0
"Well actually think about the variables' as a whole thing so just take away the variabless for the moment now you have -9 and a 3 and we are going to add these Bob. so what would that give us?
",R2
"Bob we have to have only one vairable, so once we combine the vairables then you can devide.
",R2
"sure! ahd the numbers on the vairables. what whould that give us?
",R0
"sure watch i will tipye it out on the equation then reset it for you.
",R0
"add negative nine to 3
",R0
"Just for get about the vairablese for a sec
",R0
"waht do  we donow?
",R0
"solve it bob
",R0
"nice job bob
",R0
"so know add the two number's attached to the vairables
",R0
"add the vairables
",R0
"add
",R0
"-9t to 3t
",R0
"no, you can only add it to another vairable
",R2
"like terms bob
",R0
"add -9t
",R0
"actually bob I was wrong you add 9t
",R1
"yup1
",R0
"beacause we need to cancel -9t and the only way to get rid of a negative is with a postive
",R2
"YES BOB YAYY!!!
",R0
"YES BOB!!!
",R0
"yes bob taht's correct!
",R0
"That look's right to me bob nice job!!
",R0
"now i want you to try a problem by yourself okay?
",R0
"solve
",R0
"yes!
",R0
"wait bob!!
",R0
"actually anytime you add a negative to a negative it becomes a positive okay?
",R2
"yes but you were close
",R0
"sure
",R0
"that's what it would look like.
",R0
"No bob remember you would cancel out the 6 on RHS and would add -6 to -3 on LHS which would become positive.
",R2
"Wait actually it would be 18! sorry bob i'm not  the best at math
",R1
"But to answer your question you multiply or add two negative number's then the are positve okay?
",R2
"bcause we multiplyed -6 times -3 which is 18
",R2
"yeah that was a mistake on my part sorry! remember and I should too what you do to one side you have to do to the other.
",R1
"so waht now?
",R0
"yup
",R0
"mutilpy -6
",R0
"that was wrong i think
",R1
"sorry i have lead you down a dark path
",R0
"Okay that was right with 18 but with variables you add okay?
",R2
"sure
",R0
"are you getting this?
",R0
"take all the time you need
",R0
"yes i think that is correct! good job Bob!
",R0
"What do you mean?
",R0
"NO the answer is 3/2=k
",R0
"i think
",R0
"Bob i was right from the start you add not multiply *face slap*
",R1
"so i am going to redo the problme okay?
",R0
"solve remember to ADD and not multiply
",R0
"NO Bob the nine would be positive becaues you are adding to negatives
",R2
"yes bob
",R0
"What do you think?
",R0
"Yes that's right bob So you would need to canel out the negateve 5k and add a plus 5k to a negative 7k okay?
",R2
"Yes bob nice job!
",R0
"so waht would that give us?
",R0
"yes
",R0
"Yes Bob!
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"That looks right to me bob!
",R0
"SO do you think the problem is right or wrong Bob?
",R0
"Where do you think you made a mistake?
",R0
"Acutally i am going to do the same problem and see what wen't wrong.
",R0
"DON""T DO THE PROBLEM BOB.
",R0
"yes 
",R0
"No BOb the NINE IS POSITIVE REMEMBER THIS PLEASEEE
",R0
"So bob what that shoulld look like is -3+-6 okay?
",R2
"No it is not if you did -3-6 that would be -9 But you are ADDING two negative numbers
",R2
"yes bob
",R0
"actually try adding 7k this time this may be what we were getting wrong
",R0
"You are right that was a mistakege (again) on my part let's try this problem again and do something defferent with the numbers
",R1
"this time add 3
",R0
"ypu
",R0
"yup
",R0
"To see if that was the thing we were getting wrong
",R0
"yes bob
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"do you think this is correct?
",R0
"What is your IQ level bob?
",R0
"YAY!!!
",R0
" NOw whe are going to try something REALLY hard and see how long it takes us okay?
",R0
"or do you thinkwe are ready for the test?
",R0
"yes
",R0
"Sure if it does not work out we can try the other way.
",R0
"I did not say that it will work
",R0
"Just go ahead and do it
",R0
"No it would not be negative PLEASE CHANGE THAT OUT OF YOUR CERICULUM!!
",R2
"its okay just REMEMBER
",R0
"Beacues a negative plus a negative = a positive!
",R2
"I don't understand
",R0
"It is not -7-9 its -7+-9
",R2
"PLEASE GET THAT THRU YOUR HEAD BOB
",R0
"Put in RHS 12y and contenue
",R0
"yes bob thank you
",R0
"yes
",R0
"the test but do this problem by yourself once okay?
",R0
"no
",R0
"fine
",R0
"yes let's do it again
",R0
"yes that is acually what i was going to tell you NICE JOB!
",R0
"yup
",R0
"yup
",R0
"now what?
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes now devide
",R0
"and it would actually look like -1y= 2
",R2
"try and devide -1 by 2
",R0
"YES verify your answer okay?
",R0
"yes!
",R0
"I think it all depends on whcih order you do it in
",R0
good question,R0
"I don't remember
",R0
"the test you might get it this time (hopefully)
",R0
WE will learn algebra,R0
yes,R0
no,R0
yes,R0
because if you subtract 6 from the 6 in the equation and from the 12 you should be able to divide 3 into 12-6,R2
yes,R0
yes,R0
you cannot get a proper answer if you only subtract 6,R2
divide 3 into 6,R0
you have to divide by 3 on the LHS as well to get the correct answer,R2
thank you ,R0
 yes,R0
yes ,R0
the equation is finished.great job,R0
when you see x = only one number you have your answer,R2
yes ,R0
yes,R0
yes ! very good,R0
yes,R0
correct,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes. you did awesome,R0
"I think your ready,you may take the quiz",R0
ok ,R0
yes,R0
sure,R0
yes,R0
correct,R0
add 7 to both sides,R0
yes. I think that is fine,R0
yes!Great job,R0
ok,R0
I think you are done ,R0
opps!,R0
yes ,R0
no ,R0
"sorry,I made a mistake.we will start a new problem ",R1
yes,R0
add 5 to both sides,R0
to get rid of the middle number we must add 5 to -5 and 6,R2
yes,R0
yes very good,R0
yes,R0
hmm,R0
sure,R0
no,R0
"since most of the work is on the RHS, we should start there",R2
you should subtract 2 from 2 and 5,R0
"sorry, no",R0
this problem is set up diferrently ,R0
yes,R0
ok ,R0
I know what went wrong.It should say 12=3y because you should subtract 2 from 5 to get 3,R2
"yes,I did",R0
I subtracted 2 from 5,R0
this equation is set up diferently ,R0
do you want to change the problem?,R0
"if i'm correct, you should be able to divide 3 into 3y and 12",R0
"yes,we can go to a different problem",R0
no,R0
"Sorry,I made a mistake you can add 7",R1
that seems right ,R0
yes,R0
"yes, you can",R0
that's correct,R0
yes,R0
you are doing awesome. you can take the quiz,R0
"yes,no problem",R0
no,R0
you cannot subtract 16 from 4 or you will get a negative number,R2
subtract 4 from 4 and 16,R0
no,R0
I looked at the problem you got wrong and saw you forgot to do the second step. Remember to alwas do the second step,R0
sure thing!,R0
no worries,R0
do you want to keep working on this problem or do you want to start with something else ?,R0
"ok, let's continue ",R0
yes,R0
"so in this problem, you have to divide 16-4 by 6n",R0
so you have to wright whatever you didn't solve in the first step in the LHS or the RHS,R2
LHS=12 RHS=-6n,R0
I subtracted 4 from 16 in the first step,R2
LHS=2x RHS=8,R0
ok,R0
yes I think your getting it now,R0
yes!,R0
yes! You did it!,R0
alright. did you under stand the equation?,R0
I see the problem. you added insted of subtracted,R1
"ok, if you replace ""n"" with two it should look like this  4=16-6(2)",R2
"okay I will help you.
",R0
yes,R0
No because the 10c is multiplication so we have to the opposite and that is division,R2
"well because you have to do the opposite of the situtation(addtion,subtraction,division,etc.) when doing two step equation but dividing ten was not the first step adding five is  because what you do to one side you have to do to the other",R2
yes but you did not add the five and six so you get 10c in the lhs and you get 1 in the rhs,R2
"yes
",R0
since 6 is a negativve you subtract that postive five so you get 1,R2
"no because you have not found what c is 
",R2
so you divide 1 by ten,R0
"no because c is supposed to be a number
",R2
yes,R0
"yes you can
",R0
"no thats correct
",R0
"thats correct
",R0
"yes you can go ahead
",R0
okay so you subtract 1 ,R0
"because we have eliminate one of our constants when we are doing this type of problem
 ",R2
"11k
",R0
"no 11k should be on LHS
",R0
"1 is correct on RHS
",R0
"no because 3-1 is 2
",R2
"because we havent done anything to it
",R0
"no it shouldnt it should still be -11k
",R2
no we divide 2,R0
"so you divide 2 by 11 and that answer should be in the LHS
",R0
"yes that is what i meant
",R0
"yes
",R0
yes,R0
lets try simiplifing the fraction,R0
i think tthat we should divide the 2 ,R0
the -k ,R0
"we can try that 
",R0
"yes
",R0
"-k is equal to -1 so 2 divide by negative 1 is 1
",R2
"you shouldnt by the variable you should divide by the 11 
",R0
"ues
",R0
"yes
",R0
"to put that in the equation solve it
",R0
i think the -k is 2/11,R0
lets try subtracting 3 this time,R0
"i think this one might be easier
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"the value of -k is 2/11 beacuse when you check it 1-11(2/11)=3 11x2/11 is 22/11 and that is simplfied into 2 so 1-2=3
",R2
"yes you can go ahead
",R0
"no i think we should subtract 2
",R0
"yes that sounds okay
",R0
"yes it should be 0
",R0
"we are going to divide 9 by 2
",R0
"since we are multipling in the problem we have to do the opposite to both sides
",R2
"no it should be the variable n 
",R0
"yes unless you can change the RHS 
",R0
"okay
",R0
"yes and no you got the 9/2 in the LHS but the RHS is n
",R1
"LHS- -9/2 
",R0
"yes
",R0
"no you should subtract 3
",R0
"yes thats correct
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
the problem is solved but you will need to check,R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"divide 5
",R0
"we should try both ways 
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
yes,R0
"yes
",R0

"you did good job
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yyes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"divide 4
",R0
-4,R0
"yes
",R0
"you divide 16 by -4 getting -4
",R2
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes 
",R0
we are learning algebra today,R0
okay,R0
yes,R0
no you have to subtract 3,R0
you cant subtract 5 you have to divide it so you subtract 3 from both sides to get rid of it,R2
yes,R0
yes,R0
no,R0
divide 5x and 7,R0
i dont undurstand your question,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
try another two step equation,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes good job,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
no,R0
the numbers are on the other side of the equal sign so u start on the right side now,R2
yes,R0
okay,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes you can,R0
try one more,R0
yes,R0
no,R0
its not a plus sign its a subtract sign so u do the opposite,R2
yes,R0
yes,R0
no,R0
you have to get rid of the 2 when add it to both sides,R2
14,R0
5y,R0
what are you confused about,R0
i made a mistake i put 5y instead of -5y,R1
you divide,R0
14 and -5y,R0
yes,R0
because it is on the oppisite sidenow so thats why you divide by -5y,R2
yes,R0
no you should subtract 2,R0
because the signs have change,R2
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yess,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
no you add,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
lets start the problem over to go back over our steps jason,R0
jason i made a mistake its a positive 2 so u subtract,R1
ok,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
i belive now that we keep getting -y that we should multiply the -5y instead of dividing it,R0
yes,R0
because 2 negatives equal a positive when you multiply,R2
ok,R0
where,R0
so -5y*-5y=y and -5y*11=-55,R2
ok,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
multiply -6,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
no divide,R0
yes,R0
yea,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
no try to get all the numbers with varibles on one side and all the constants on one side before you try to multiply or divide,R2
yes,R0
so you would subtract 6x from 7x,R0
because 7x and 6x both have x and it would be easier to add and subtract if you have the same on both sides,R2
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
lets try another problem,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
try to divide both by x,R0
sure what did you get for rhs,R0
lets try a diffrent problem to see if you can get this right,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yea,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
I am going to teach you linear algebra,R0
sure ,R0
"yes
",R0
"no you need to add 12 
",R0
"you need to add 12 because there is a negetive 12 and in order to get rid of it or get it to zero you so that you only have 3x you have to add 12 to both sides of the equation 
",R2
"you did not add 12 to the other side as well
",R1
"no now you have to divide both side by 3 so that you are left with only x and the answer 
",R2
"no 
",R0
"yes 
",R0
"you have to divide by 3 on both sides 
",R0
"yes

",R2
"yes that is correct 
",R0
"yes 
",R0
"yes 
",R0
"you have to add 6
",R0
"so that you only have -4y

I am going to teach you linear algebra,R0
2y-3= 12,R0
No you need to add 3 because there is a negative 3,R2
yes,R0
It is ,R0
You still haven't found what y is equal to.,R2
you have to divide by 2,R0
the problem is 2y which is multiply so you must do the opposite,R2
"that is correct
",R0
"you must solve that equation, not just 15/2
",R0
"yes
",R0
"you can do this problem 10y-8=12
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yeah
",R0
"yep
",R0
"yes
",R0
"right
",R0
"you solved it
",R0
"3y+4=10
",R0
"you would need to subtract 4
",R0
"because the 4 is positive and you need to do the opposite of what the equation is
",R2
"yes
",R0
"also correct
",R0
"thats is right
",R0
"yes you solved the problem
",R0
"your next question will be 10=-6-4y
",R0
"you need to add 6 instead
",R0
"the question was just flipped so you just do the same that you were doing earlier on the right side
",R2
"yes
",R0
"yea
",R0
"you would divide by -4
",R0
"because a negative divided by a negitive is a positive
",R2
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"thank you
",R0
"your next problem will be 5x+6=3x+4
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yep
",R0
"right
",R0
"no you would divide by 3 because you divide by the smaller number
",R2
"actually it 
was subtract 3x",R1
"yes
",R0
"whatever 5x-3x is
",R0
"it would be 2x

"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"2y-3=6-y
",R0
"you would add 3 because there is a negative 3
",R2
"yes
",R0

",R2
"you need to do the opposite to get rid of it -y-y =-2

",R0
"yes
",R0
"no you need to add 9
",R0
"you would need to add 9 instead
",R0
"yes
",R0
"you would have to do the equation
",R0
"the left hand side is not correct you still need to add the 9 onto 7c
",R2
"yes 
",R0
"the equation is 6
",R0
"6
+n=-2-4n",R0
"no you should just subtract 6
",R0
"yes
",R0
"add 4n
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"I think you would subtract 5
",R0
"you have to get the n so it is alone and in this case that is what you would have to do
",R2
"yes
",R0
"no it would be just n
",R0
"because there was still numbers that didn't have a variable
. ",R2

Liniar Algebra equations.,R0
Try to solve this one.,R0
yes but remember to subtract 2 on the LHS and RHS.,R0
"Yes, nice job.",R0
"yes
",R0
yes,R0
you should start by adding x from both side,R0
Since there is a negative variable.,R2
"you should just write three since you added the x
",R2
Yes that is correct.,R0
yes,R0
"Wait no the problem is not done until the variable is a set value so you have to subtract 5
",R2
yes but since the variable is negative you have to change that first.,R2
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
"yes
",R0
you can but I would recomend subtracting 2 so the variable is alone.,R2
The difference is that the 5 is now part of a variable.,R2
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"You should divide by 5 so you get just get one variable
",R2
"yes
",R0
"correct you have solved it
",R0
"yes
",R0
"You did well you just forgot to fully complete the problem
",R0
try this one,R0
That isn't the most efficient way I would subtract 6 since it is with the variable.,R2
"correct
",R0
"nice now one step left
",R0
yes allways make sure that when you think that you are finished that the variable is single and positive,R2
"correct
",R0
yes,R0
correct,R0
"you did a great job on the single part of finishing an equation but you forgot to make the variable positive
",R2
"ok
",R0
"I would say that you should add three x to make it positive
",R0
"yes
",R0
"correct
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"correct
",R0
"yes
",R0
"Do you feel comfortable with that or do you want another one
",R0
"ok
",R0
"try this one
",R0
"yes so the variable is positive
",R2
"yes
",R0
"correct
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"correct
",R0
"Nice job
",R0
"Do you want to take the quiz or do you want take more practice
",R0
"I am going to teach you a faster way for you to solve problems with a negative variable
",R0
"I am going to teach you how first the first step is to divide by -3
",R0
"Because -3 is before the variable and the variable is alone
",R2
"yes
",R0
"correct now remember only do this when the variable is alone
",R0
"Yes but this is a more dificult technic
",R0
"try this one
",R0
"first remember that the varible has to be alone
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"correct
",R0
"yes
",R0
"ready for the quiz
",R0
"One more question probobly try it on your own
",R0
"yes
",R0
"Nice job
",R0
"correct
",R0
"yes
",R0
"I think you are ready for the quiz
",R0
"nice job on the quiz
",R0
"now for the next section
",R0
"Alrigt first pick a side for the varibles and one side for the numbers
",R0
"yes
",R0
"Yes or you can also move the x in the same step
",R0
"yes
",R0
"Now you should subtract x
",R0
"because since LHS is for numbers RHS is for variables
",R2
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"Are you comfortable with this material
",R0
"You did well you just forgot about the sides on the third one
",R0
"you can pick either one but you shouldn't change once you have started a problem
",R0
"ok
",R0
"sure
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"Since x is single but not positive you should multiply by negative one or chand the sign of both sides
",R2
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"you did
",R0
"Are you ready for the quiz or do you want more practice
",R0
"Lets try the quiz
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes

"correct nice job
",R0
"sure
",R0
"I am going to teach you linear algebra
",R0
x+4=8,R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
that's right!,R0
"yes. the equation is solved
",R0
"here is a two step equation:
",R0
"2x+3=11
",R0
"yes
",R0
"No.You should start by subtracting 3 from both sides.
",R0
"These are different questions. The first question was only a one step equation, which allowed you to subtract 4
",R0
"great!
",R0
"yes
",R0
"You need to get x by itself. In order to do that, you have to divide 2 on both sides.
",R2
"yes
",R0
that's correct!,R0
"yes. In order to solve equations like this, you have to get x by itself.
",R2
"yes
",R0
"Okay.
",R0
10=4-4y,R0
"yes
",R0
"You need to subtract the 4 on both sides, in order to get the 4y by it's self.
",R2
"yes
",R0
" Now, you need to get the
 y variable by it's self. ",R0
"You need to divide by -4
",R0
"If you divide by positive 4, the negative sign would stay with the variable. You need to get the varible by its self in order to solve this equation. 
",R2
"yes
",R0
"yes, this is the same as LHS= y, and RHS= -3/2. They are just flipped
",R2
"yes. this is solved. Lets take the quiz, and see how you do.
",R0
"Thanks! I am going to now teach you linear equations on both sides.
",R0
"Here is one:
",R0
"7+v=3-4v
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes.
 That is correct.",R0
"yes. If you subtract 7 on both sides, v will be the only thing left on the LHS
",R2
"Now, you need to add 4v on both sides, to get the variables together. 
",R2
"Instead of adding -4v which is in the RHS column, you need to add the opposite. 
",R2
"Yes.
",R0
"Now, you need to divide 5 on both sides, to get the variable by it's self.
",R2
"You should write v instead of wrting 1v, because they are the same thing
",R2
"yes, that is correct! Lets try another example. 
",R0
"11y-7=12y+9
",R0
"try this!
",R0
"yes!
",R0
"No, you want to add 7, instead of subtracting -7, because 7 is the opposite of -7
",R2
"after you add 7, the -7 is gone, leaving 11y in the LHS
",R2
"yes
",R0
"No, you need to get the variables and numbers on opposite sides now.
",R2
"You need to divide 11 on both sides. on the LHS side, dividing 11 would leave y. On the RHS side, you would get 1 1/12.
",R2
"Now, you have the 11y instead of 7+v. The 11 and y are together which is multiplication. The 7 and V are separate, and it has an addition
 sign",R2
"Yes.
",R0
"No, instead of divining the 12y and the 16, you need to divide only the 12y.
",R0
Lets try this problem again. 11y-7=12y+9,R0
"yes. You can start by adding seven., to both sides.",R0
yep!,R0
yes. Now you need to get the variables on one side. Hyou can subtract 12y from both sides. To get 16 by itself. ,R2
Not yet. You can't have a negative variable. You have to multiply by one on both sides to make the variable positive. ,R2
if you subtract 12y from 11y you whould get -y not y.,R2
"yes. Rhs should be 16 now, but you aren't done yet. ",R2
"you need to multiply -y by -1 to make it positive. Then, you need to also multiply 16 by -1.",R2
yep! Lets do another problem!,R0
9x=-7-5x,R0
yes. ,R0
Yes. You need to add 5x in order to get the variable and the number seperated.,R2
yep.,R0
yes. Now you need to solve for x.,R2
yes. you can divide by 14 to get x by its self.,R2
yes! That's right.,R0
"Its okay! Lets try this question:
",R0
"7c-10=8-9c
",R0
"yes
",R0
"Yes. Now you need to add 9c to both sides 
",R0
"Yes. Now solve for c
",R2
"I don't know why that happened. Lets try the problem a different way.
",R0
"lets start put by subtracting 7c from both sides.
",R0
"yes
",R0
"Yes. Now subtract 8 from both sides to seperate the variable.
",R2
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"I think thats correct! Lets try another problem!
",R0
"6+n=-2-4n
",R0
"Yfes
",R0
"Yes.
",R0
"Yes. Now you need to add 2 on both sides 
",R0
"yes
",R0
"Almost there. You need to divide by -5 on both sides
",R0
"Because if you don't need to seperate the variable, you don't need to divide. We multiplied -x because you can't have a negative variable.
",R2
"That's right! Lets try to take the quiz again.
",R0
"This is another question
",R0
"3x-6=x+2
",R0
"yep
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yep
",R0
"No, you should subtract x from both sides.
",R0
"Yes. If you were to subtract x from both sides, it wouldallow the variable and the number to become seperated if they stay together through the equation, you will never solve it. 
",R2
"Yes. 
",R0
"Yes. Divide by 2 to get x by ita self
",R2
"That is right! 
",R0
"Try this one now:
",R0
"7c-10=8-9c
",R0
"lets try this by first adding 9c to both sides
",R0
"yep
",R0
"yep
",R0
"yes
",R0
"no, it shouldbe 18
",R2
"No, it should 16c.sorry!
",R1
"Yes. Now, lets try the quiz again.
",R0
"lets try this:
",R0
"3x-6=x+2
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yep
",R0
"yes
",R0
"No, you want to wubtract x from both sidew. Leave the 8 where it is for now.
",R0
"yes
",R0
"Yep. Now you need to divide both sides by 2 toget x by itself
",R2
"yes
",R0
"Yep! 
",R0
"Now lets try the quiz again, to see if you get all of thequestions right.
",R0
"Yes. That is right.
",R0
"Now lets do the quiz again.
",R0
"lets try this equation again.
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yep
",R0
"X+8
",R0
"Youcant add negative 8 or positive 8 to anything. If you add or subtract something on the RHS column, you have to do the same to the LHS column. In this case, there isn't anything to add.
",R2
"2x. Because you need to subtract x from both wides now.
",R2
"yep
",R0
"Yes. That is right.
",R0
"yep
",R0
"Yep! Now lets try the quiz again!
",R0
"yes
",R0
"You did!
",R0
Hi I am going to teach you how to solve liner equations,R0
"first i need to test your knowledge on the subject, to get an idea of where you are",R0
"you handled one step equations very well, but it appears you need more practice on two step equations",R0
I would combine the positive 3 with the negitive 7 first,R2
i would combine the +3 with the -7,R2
add the +3 with the -7,R0
no,R0

I took the Positive three and added it to the -7,R2
try to simplify the LHS,R2
yes!,R0

",R0
Because I am trying to get rid of the 7 and i add 7 to make it cancel out. I do this so the number with the variable is by it self,R2
"no
",R0
"Because on the LHS,the variable is next to -2 which means we multiply. We want to get rid of the -2 and have the variable by itself so we divide and the -2 cancels out.
",R2
"yes
",R0
"Or 9/-2
",R0
"yes, it is solved
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"good.
",R0
"yes
",R0
"no
",R0
"Wait, you're right!
",R1
"I didn't simplify so we are both right
",R2
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"Yes or subtract 1
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"You are done
",R0
"Or you could make the 2 negative
",R0
"You are sort of done solving it. You could make the x positive and the 2 negative to have x be positive
",R2
"Or you could leave it
",R0
"I got to think
",R0
"Give me a second
",R0
"So -x is the same thing as -1x because there is only one x. Then you have the equation -1x=2. You then divide by -1 on both sides and that gives you x=-2
",R2
"For this problem, you could rewrite it as 5x+2=12
",R2
"yes you can
",R0
"Or just subtract 2
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"Or you could put x=2 but they are the same
",R2
"yes
",R0
"Are you ready for a quiz?
",R0
"sure
",R0
"good job
",R0
"yes
",R0
"You could but I would do something else first
",R0
"Ill show you
",R0
"It doesn't matter, you could have done -6x, it probably would have been easier. Lets change that
",R0
"yes
",R0
"No, you are trying to solve for x
",R2
"Well you want to get the x on one side of the equation and the numbers on the other side. 
",R2
"yes
",R0
"Sure but you also could -2x
",R0
"You could but I like to do it the other way
",R0
"But its up to you
",R0
"Whoops, I meant -3x
",R1
"Because we want to make sure both of the variables are on the same side. So we got rid of the 3x on the RHS
",R2
"Or -1x
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"Yes. To check your work, you can plug that into the equation so it would be 2*-10-6=4+3*-10. See if that works
",R2
"Yup, you are correct.
",R0
"lets do another example where you plug the x back in
",R0
"How about 1-11k=3
",R0
"yes
",R0
"Yes you got it right
",R0
"It is fun!
",R0
"-10+8q=8+2q
",R0
"yes
",R0
"Yes but this time try it the way where you subtract the number with the variable
",R0
"yea
",R0
"Yes but it is more understandable if you just add 10 because it is the same thing
",R0
"yes
",R0
"If they weren't equal, you know you did something wrong.
",R2
"Let me give you a few more problesm
",R0
"add
",R0
"Because you want to make -5r equal 0 to cancel out
",R2
"yes
",R0
"yup
",R0
"no
",R0
"On a side note, remember that 10-5r is the same as -5r
+10",R2
"sure

"yea
",R0
"make sure you simplify first

"yup
",R0
"Next one
",R0
"Here is another problem where you have to simplify and combine like terms

"yup
",R0
"You have gotten a lot better
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"Here is another question. what is -3*-3
",R0
"Yes it is 
",R0
"yes because 2 negatives make a positive when you multiply
",R2
"Ok lets take a quiz, are you ready? Any questions?
",R0
"oh
",R0
"I wrote the wrong thing
",R1
"Go ahead
",R0
"This is the same problem as the one on your quiz

"the terms are 2x, 3, and 5
",R2
"There are 2 types of terms, Constant terms and variable terms. 
",R0
"Constant terms are terms withouth a variable. Variable terms are numbers with a variable.
",R0
"Ex; 2= constant term.
",R2
"2x=variale term
",R2
"Coefficient- number that is next to a variable. 
",R0
"ex: 2x-coeffecient is 2
",R2
"because 2 is next to the x-variable
",R2
"the coefficient would be -1 because -x is the same as -1x
",R2
"Like terms-terms that have the same variable and exponent
",R0
"There are two types of like terms
",R0
"you don't need to know that yet
",R0
"Constant like terms and variable like terms
",R0
"ex: constant like terms   2,3,7,12
",R2
"constant like terms can also be 5,-4,6
",R2
"variable like terms:    2x, 17x, -13x.
",R2
"Also, 2xy,5xy,91xy, and -32xy are like variable
",R2
"Its fine.
",R0
"make sure you don't get rid of the variable. I think you subtracted the variable out of the equation and that was where you messed up.
",R2
"here is the problem you missed.
",R0
"-10-6y=10y+5
",R0
"sure
",R0
"Try that
",R0
"Wait, do you get a negative constant number or a negative term with a variable?
",R0
"ok
",R0
"For this one, try subtracting 9r first
",R0
"For this same one, why don't you start with -10? 
",R0
"no
",R0
"Solve that but start with -10
",R0
"yes
",R0
"IS this what you struggle with?
",R0
"yes
",R0
"Oh yeah, I misunderstood you.
",R1
"You are right
",R0
"let me check
",R0
"no
",R0
"You didn't add 11x to 3x
",R2
"Oh wait whoops
",R1
"You are right
",R0
"yes
",R0
"No, you don't
",R0
"You don't want to get rid of the variable
",R2
"Also remeber that subtracting -4x is the same thing as add 4x
",R2
"Perform +3
",R0
"yup!
",R0
"Do you want to?
",R0
"ok
",R0
"Go ahead and start
",R0
"yup
",R0
"After this lets take the quiz
",R0
"Wwait
",R0
"LHS was wrong
",R0
"yes
",R0
"re verify the lhs
",R0
"Yes because adding a negative number is the same as subtraction
",R2
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"no
",R0
"Don't cancel out the variable
",R0
"Your good
",R0
"I could use that but it is good practice to think up your own problems
",R0
"Do you want me to use the problem bank?
",R0
"ok
",R0
"Do you know how to multiply?
",R0
"Sure let me think of one
",R0
"3*2 can you solve that?
",R0
"So you do know how to multiply
",R0
"oh
",R0
"Try that, i don't know if it will work
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"Multiply by7
",R0
"Because you multiply by the recipricol to cancel out the fraction
",R2
"No, because you have x/7
",R2
"For example, to make x/6 cancel out, you multiply by 6/1 or 6
",R2
I'm going to teach you linear algebra equations,R0
"okay you may solve thiss
",R0
"beacuse it balances out the sides because -7 is on the LHS
",R2
"becauseon the LHS it is -2n and dividing that by -2 and the RHSgets you the value of n
",R2
"yes, it is solved for n
",R2
"lets practice another two setep equation
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes, lets move on to a quiz
",R0
"the variable can be on either side of the the equal sign
",R2
"For this problem, add 4 instead of subtracting 8
",R0
"Adding 4 is the more efficient way to slove this, but subtracting 8 would eventually get you the same answers
",R0
"add 4
",R0
"correct
",R0
"correct
",R0
"now you have to divide by 3 to get the value of x
",R2
"right
",R0
"yes
",R0
"that is correct
",R0
"lets try one more problem like this before you take the quiz
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yep
",R0
"corect
",R0
"yes!
",R0
"yes
",R0
"that is correct
",R0
"lets try the quiz now
",R0
"Go ahead
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"instead of dividing by 2 whenthere are variables on both sides of the equation, subtract 3x to get -x = 10
",R2
"if you subtract the 2x instead, it still works the same, it is just less efficient
",R0
"correct
",R0
"because the x on the LHS is negative, you can switch the symbols to make it x = -10
",R2
"you can divide by -1 to get x
",R0
"yes
",R0
"you got it
",R0
"that is correct
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"no, you shouldn
",R0
"no, you shouldn't subtract 14 because that's not going to get you anywhere
",R2
"instead you shouldsubtract c to get 4c on the LHS
",R2
"yes
",R0
"yep
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"that is correct
",R0
"a harder equation with variables on both sides
",R0
"no, it doesn't make sense to add 7 because that won't get you anywhere.instead and 5x
",R2
"add 5x
",R0
"no, it doesn't beacuase there are variables on 
both sides of the equation",R2
"we are going to do one more
",R0
"sure
",R0
"thats correct
",R0
"thats correct
",R0
"now, you will add 7
",R0
"yes
",R0
"that correct
",R0
"yes
",R0
"that is right
",R0
"i would start by either adding 3 or subtracting 2
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"that is not correct becuase 5x+2 doesn't equal . A x 
 means that it can be added with non variable numbers",R2
"that is correct, but only if the value of x is 1
",R2
"You are right
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"always start by subtracting the non variable numbers
",R2
"it will make things easier
",R0
"yes
",R0
"thats correct
",R0
"that right
",R0
"no, you shouldn't because that just adds an unecessary step to solving for t
",R2
"you should subtract 3t
",R0
"thats right
",R0
"thats right
",R0
"you got it
",R0
"yes
",R0
"good job
",R0
"yes, you have solved for t
",R2
"thats right
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"correct
",R0
"that right
",R0
"no, you cannot add 6 becuase it is not efficient and it would just put the 6 on the other side of the equation, and would just add another step
",R2
"instead, subtract 12x
",R0
"yep
",R0
"right
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes, or you could just divide by 5
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"that is right
",R0
"the problem is solved
",R0
"thats correct
",R0
"how about you recheck with parantheses around -1/5
",R0
yes,R0
ok,R0
LHS,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
it should be -4,R2
yes,R0
yes,R0
thank you,R0
no,R0
the equation still has one more step,R2
of course,R0
"yes. If a number is neighbouring a variable, you must divide by the opposite of said number.",R2
no,R0
no. When dividing said equation the negative sign would be removed.,R2
"when dividing by an opposite, you must always switch to the positive number",R2
-2v/2=v,R2
i am mistaken,R1
step 2,R0
no,R0
i am mistaken you are correct,R1
that is correct,R0
no,R0
"whenever you get v=a number, you are correct",R2
thank you,R0
yes,R0
no,R0
"you must not pick the LHS, but rather the side with the variable on it",R2
that would be the correct step,R0
yes,R0
because the four is a positive four,R2
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
that is ok,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
"any number divided by itself will always equal on, or in this case just the single digit variable",R2
"any number divided by itself will always equal one, or in thus case just the single digit variable",R2
no,R0
"you typed an equation, not a number",R2
i am mistaken you are correct,R1
yes,R0
correct,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
no,R0
yes,R0
because there is a +13 on the LHS,R2
yes,R0
no,R0
yes,R0
ues,R0
sorry yes,R1
add 6,R0
because that makes it simpler by leaving us with only one variable to deal with,R2
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
that is correct,R0
ues,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
subtract 4y,R0
because there is already a singled out variable and the opposite of +4y is -4y,R2
on the left hand side there is a lone variable,R2
"iif it is a positive variable, you subtract. If it is a negative variabke, you add",R2
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
yes,R0
that is correct,R0
yes,R0
"Hi I am Audrey. I will be teaching you linear algebra today.
",R0
"Yes.
",R0
"Yes, you want to isolate the variable. The subtract two tells you to add so that you have nothing.
",R2
"Yes.
",R0
"Yes.
",R0
"Correct.
",R0
"not yet, you have to have variables on one side and numbers on the other.
",R2
"So that we have variables on one side and number on the other.
",R2
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"Yes, although what you have is an improper fraction, the proper way to say it is 2 2/7.",R2
"Yes, that is fine.
",R0
"Yes, understood.
",R0
"You could, but is would be better to divide by -2, so that you are done.
",R2
"Yes.
",R0
"Yes.
",R0
"Perfect.
",R0
"Correct.
",R0
"this is a two step equation. You will want to add or subtract before multiplying or  dividing.
",R2
"How can you add or subtract in the LHS?
",R0
"Yes, you have a -4 and a +4 and you get 0
",R2
"Yes.
",R0
"Correct.
",R0
"Now how can you divide or multiply to isolate the variable?
",R0
"I will give you some equations using the same tactic after we solve this equation.
",R0
"Correct.
",R0
"Yes.
",R0
"Yes, you could have divided by Y, but that would not have gone well. Let's see what happens when you do.
",R0
"Yes.
",R0
"Correct.
",R0
"Yes you have. i will give you another problem before I quiz you again. Great job!
",R0
"Yes, perfect!
",R0
"No, you have a plus two in the LHS, so you need a minus two.
",R2
"Perfect.
",R0
"Yes.
",R0
"Yes.
",R0
"No,but now you need to multiply or divide.",R2
"Yes, you should divide. I said that after addition or subtraction, multiplication of division came next. Whichever of them works with the problem.",R2
"I will after I quiz you.
",R0
"True.
",R0
"Okay.
",R0
"Correct.
",R0
"Yes, correct.
",R0
"do you want me to quiz you.
",R0
"Break a leg.
",R0
"You did fine.
",R0
No this is a pretty easy two step equation.,R0
"It is a two step equation because you did any one step, you would still have to do more to isolate the variable.
",R2
"Yes, that is not the way I would do it, but it works the same way.
",R0
"I would subtract three so that a star at the ent of the problem, not in the middle.
",R0
"Yes, you are completely right. But in some equations order does matter, so watch out!
",R0
"I will give you a problem for which it does matter once were done with this one.
",R0
"You could do it either way to achieve that goal.
",R0
"Yes the LHS is correct.
",R0
"Yes.
",R0
"Perfect.
",R0
"Correct.
",R0
"Wonderful!
",R0
"Yes it is. what is you Question.
",R0
"No, the variable will not always be in the LHS, this next problem will demonstrate.
",R0
"Yes.
",R0
"I don't under stand the question.
",R0
"The Difference is if you do one thing in this problem you create more steps for yourself. In the last problem either way will give you the same number of steps.
",R2
"Here, if you add 11k, what happens?
",R0
"I'll show you.
",R0
"No, it doesn't make the situation easier it also doesn't make it harder. All you did was put the 11k on the other side of the equation, but it does not isolate the variable.
",R2
"Yes, that is the easiest way.
",R0
"It is different because the RHS has the variables this time.
",R2
"Bingo!
",R0
"Bullseye!
",R0
"You got it
!",R0
"You should divide by -11 because then you are done.
",R2
"If you divide by 11 then what do you get?
",R0
"Right, but you're not solving for a negative variable. Now you have do divide by -1 to get -2/11=k. If you do that, you just made a two step equation into a three step equation.
",R2
"Thanks.
",R0
"Yes.
",R0
"Correct.
",R0
"perfect. would you like me to quiz you now?
",R0
"yep
",R0
"That's okay i will give you one last one step equiation before I have to go.
",R0
"Yes.
",R0
"Perfect. Great job, Gertrude!
",R0
"Yes.
",R0
"Correct.
",R0
"Yes you solved it. I'll see you tomorrow.
",R0
"We're going to practice with variables on both sides.
",R0
"Good Job.
",R0
"Yes, you have learned a lot.
",R0
"Go ahead.
",R0
"I'll give you an example when we finish this equation.
",R0
9x-3/4=17,R0
"The first step is adding 3/4 to both sides. What do you g
et?",R0
"That is perfect.
",R0
"Great job.
",R0
"No, what would you get if you did that?
",R0
"If you divided by -6 you would get (9+7x)/6=X. Then you would have to add 7x/6. This could work, but there are other ways to do it.
",R2
"What earlier scenario?
",R0
"After you add 5 you should -7x. Can you tell me what you get?
",R0
"Yep.
",R0
"Yes that is correct.
",R0
"You're doing great.
",R0
"That is correct.
",R0
"Bullseye.
",R0
"The problem is solved.
",R0
"Do you want to take a quiz or do another problem/
",R0
"I think you have a 50/50 chance.
",R0
"Congrats on getting one of the problems right. It;s a start.
",R0
"coming right up.
",R0
"This is the problem I gave you in the chat earlier.
",R0
"Perfect.
",R0
"That is right.
",R0
"Yes you are.
",R0
"Yes, that sounds right.
",R0
"You're getting good.
",R0
"We usually do, but not necessarily. I will give you an example in the next problem.
",R0
"Yes.
",R0
"Yes, perfect.
",R0
"The problem is solved. Would you like to take a quiz?
",R0
"No.
",R0
"No problemo.
",R0
"I can't think of a problem that has multiplication as its last function right now. Sorry.
",R0
"You will probably have a number= variable over a number, that is when you know to multiply.
",R2
"That works.
",R0
"Yes.
",R0
"Correct.
",R0
"Subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive. But yes, that would work.
",R2
"You got it.
",R0
"Yes.
",R0
"Awesome.
",R0
"Yes.
",R0
"Yes.
",R0
"The problem is solved.
",R0
"Sure. Break a leg.
",R0
"That's fine.I took some of the problems from the quiz so we can work on them.
 ",R0
"Yes.
",R0
"Like I said yesterday, no, you can get rid of the numbers from the RHS if you like
",R2
"Great job!
",R0
"B-I-N-G-O.
\",R0
"Wonderful!
",R0
"Yes.
",R0
"You're amazing!
\",R0
"Yes.
",R0
"Uh-huh
",R0
"Correct.
",R0
"You solved the problem by yourself.
",R0
"Sure, if you want to.
",R0
"You are a great student.
",R0
"Yes, fantastic observation. Yes you can subtract 2.
",R0
"Yes.
",R0
"Great job!
",R0
"Adding a negative is the same as subtracting a positive, yes, you can -x.
",R2
"Yes , that is correct.
",R0
"Yes, you just solved the problem.
",R0
"Kidding, you still have one more step. Sorry.
",R1
"Yeah, Gertrude!
",R0
"Perfect.
",R0
"You just solved the problem all by yourself. 
",R0
"Actually this time.
",R0
"Let's take the quiz. I think you're ready.
",R0
"That's ok I recorded where you got it wrong, let's try again.
",R0
"No problemo.
",R0
"What you want to do is get numbers on one side, and variables on the other. What do you think you should do to do that.
",R2
"Yes.
",R0
"Yep.
",R0
"You're so smart.
",R0
"Yes.
",R0
"Yes.
",R0
"Yes. Let's quiz your knowledge.
",R0
"algebra
",R0
"yes
",R0
"no
",R0
"because you need to get x by itself
",R2
" and that does not take one step
",R0
because you can not get rid of the seven and the three in one step,R2
"no you should add seven so you dont get x-14+3=5
",R2
"so you get rid of the 7 rather than making it a 14
",R2
"yes
",R0
"no you should carry down the 5 from the first row
",R2
" you should write 5
",R0
no what you do to one side you do to the other,R2
"you were right earliear. sorry.
",R1
"yes that is correct
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes that is perfect
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes because you cant simplify it any more
",R2
"sure
",R0
"no not at all
",R0
"no because that leaves nothing on the LHS
",R2
"because this time you only have one number in the LHS
",R2
"YOU SHOULD GET ON SOMETHING IN THE RHS
",R2
"you should get rid of the -4
",R2
"correct
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"no because this -4 is connected to the y
",R2
"because there are -4 y's
",R2
"sure
",R0
"divide by  -4
",R0
"to get y by itself
",R2
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"correct
",R0
"solve
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"no because 5x isnt negative 
",R2
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes

"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"you can always subtract 3 if it helps you get just number or just variables on one side
",R2
"yes
",R0
"normally you have a number with a variable not always
 ",R2
"and yes you can have a fraction with a variable

",R0
"yes
",R0
"yup
",R0
"lets do one more
 problem",R0
"i think it is two steps
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"you can flip the negative from the x to the 2. and that makes it easier to read
",R2
"i think it is just a cool trick that you can do
",R0
"there isnt a transformation
",R0
"yes
",R0
"i dont tink so
",R0
"swap the minus sign
",R0
"ok lets do a quiz
",R0
"yes
",R0
"since you are subtracting 6 it is -20
",R2
"i was wrong
",R1
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"you should subtract 5c
",R0
"you want to get the variables on one side by themselves
",R2
"yes dividing by a negative number would swap the negative
",R2
"divide by -5
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"you should do +5x to get the variables on one side
",R2
"because  this time you would be moving the seven from the RHS to the LHS
",R2
"YOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO GET THE VARIABLES ON ONE SIDE AND THE NUMBERS ON THE OTHER. BUT SUBTRACTING SEVEN WOULD NOT ACHIVE THAT OBJECTIVE.
",R2
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes so you can get the variable on one side

"we are going to do some simple problems to start off
",R0
"ok try sloving this one 
",R0
"ok take your time
",R0
"yes i think you can  
",R0
"because 4 is next to x and it  is also in the equasion and we want  to find the value of x so i guess thats why 
",R2
"ok good 
",R0
"you are  a grate student 
",R0
"yes good job 
",R0
"yes you are correct i think 
",R0
"yes divide my 4 
",R0
"ok 
",R0
"so do you think you understand it 
",R0
"no we are done with that one 
",R0
"would you like to move on to the next one 
",R0
"ok let me think 
",R0
"ok 
",R0
"yes good job 
",R0
"now what is the RHS of the equation 
",R0
"yes good job 
",R0
"yes 
",R0
"are you ready to take a quiz
",R0
"yes what is it 
",R0
"yes your right do yo uthink you are ready for negetive numbers 
",R0
"no you  dont  
",R0
"ok try  this one 
",R0
"maybe 
",R0
"yes i think it will
",R0
"maybe 
",R0
"i dont know
",R0
"ok 
",R0
"no you did not 
",R0
"do you think that it would be zero 
",R0
"maybe we should multiply insted of divide 
",R0
"the LHS
",R0
"lets try a diffrent problem 
",R0
"think about  this one 
",R0
"i  think  you will be able to do it though
",R0
"you have to move the seven  to the other side i think 
",R2
"i think 
",R0
"do you think that you would divide my 7 
",R0
"after  this equation do you think you are ready to take a quiz 
",R0
"yeah you are correct 
",R0
"so i  think that we should add 7 
",R0
"that way you dont have a negetive number anymore 
",R2
"yes good job  
",R0
"wow you are a fast learner 
",R0
"yes 
",R0
"yes 
",R0
"ok do you think you are ready for your quiz 
",R0
"no not yet 
",R0
"yes give me a moment 
",R0
"ok 
",R0
"i mean that we can also subtract or multiply 
",R0
"yes
",R0
"do you  ungerstand now
",R0
"understand*
",R0
"have you tried adding 7
",R0
"no 
",R0
"ok try that 
",R0
"yes thats a good way  to think 
",R0
"so i think you  should try adding seven to every number  and see what that gets you 
",R0
"yes i think you should 
",R0
"ok what number do you think we could divide/subtract or multiply 
",R0
"i think that you should divide
",R0
"ok lets try that 
",R0
"yes lets try  2 
",R0
"yes me too
",R0
"how about we divide -2 
",R0
"yyay 
",R0
"so  are you 
",R0
"yes 
",R0
"ok 
",R0
"yes 
",R0
"ya 
",R0
"i  am going to have you take a quiz 
",R0
"is that  ok 
",R0
"yes i will help you  dont worry 
",R0
"lets try one 
",R0
"lets try this one 
",R0
"yes but they are all diffrent 
",R0
"yes 
",R0
"the 10 is a positive number  here 
",R2
"so why  would you need to add 10 
",R0
"no 
",R0
"i think that we should divide 
",R0
"why  dont we try dividing 2 
",R0
"but the 10 is not a negetive number so why  would we need to add  10 
",R2
"ok 
",R0
"ok yes you are  correct so do you think that we should add 6 
",R0
"yes i was mistaken you are correct 
",R1
"i think that we should add 6 to the equation would be a good idea 
",R0
"so why  dont  we try  that 
",R0
"ok 
",R0
"yes
",R0
"now try adding 6 to -6 next 
",R0
"yes we just have to do another step after that 
",R0
"ok 
",R0
"yes great idea 
",R0
"umm let me think 
",R0
"no i just had to go 
",R0
"sorry about that 
",R0
"now what question where we on 
",R0
"um let me think 
",R0
"ok heres one 
",R0
"try this one 
",R0
"ok
",R0
"yes 
",R0
"yes 
",R0
"it should look like this 
",R0
"because when you add 7 to one number  you  add seven to the other number too
",R2
"oh yes 
",R0
"woop sorry 
",R1
"no your ok 
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes 
",R0
"what about this
",R0
"ok 
",R0
"because we added 7 
",R2
"umm how do you think it  would change it 
",R0
"what do you mean by only effect another number 
",R0
"yes so if you added 7 to -7 you would get 0 
",R2
"yes 
",R0
"but we cn just take away the 0 
",R2
"good job 
",R0
"yes 
",R0
"thanks so are you 
",R0
"oh i think that we should have gotten 7n not -7n 
",R2
"is that what you  think 
",R0
"or do you think that we should do some other step for the -2n 
",R0
"i think that we should try  something else 
",R0
"ok what  logic do you  want 
",R0
"ok just ask  me 
",R0
"wait give me a minute to think this out 
",R0
"yes thats what i meant 
",R0
"but how about we try something else and see if that works 
",R0
"ok take your times 
",R0
"time*
",R0
"ok 
",R0
"actually you would get 5 
",R0
"for the -2n would become 5n if you added seven 
",R2
"ok so i think what we are on the right track 
",R0
"ok i am doing that right now 
",R0
"what do you think of this 
",R0
"yes 
",R0
"yay
",R0
"yes 
",R0
"so all i did was added 7 to -2n and that gives me 5n 
",R2
"does that help 
",R0
"yes so what do you need to know 
",R0
"because did you subtract the two 
",R0
"ok so maybe we need to keep the -2n for now 
",R0
"ok so i thinki figured it out 
",R0
"yes thats ok why dont we do that 
",R0
"no it was my mistake 
",R1
"yes 
",R0
"yes you solved it 
",R0
"YAY 
",R0
"ok so do you think you are ready to try again on your quiz 
",R0
"thats ok 
",R0
"dont worry you will be ok 
",R0
"you did so well on the one 
",R0
"do you want to do one more before you do the quiz 
",R0
"ok 
",R0
"yes 
",R0
"ok lets try this one 
",R0
"ok 
",R0
"sure lets try that 
",R0
"yes 
",R0
"yes 
",R0
"see you are doing so well 
",R0
"yes 
",R0
"i think that  you are correct 
",R0
"yes 
",R0
"see how fat you did that one 
",R0
"ok 
",R0
2x-5=10,R0
"No.That is not correct
",R0
"do you want me to help
",R0
because you need to add 5 to ten first,R0
"to get rid of the five
",R2
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"no
",R0
"you now need to divide the 2 fro
m 15",R0
"You have to get the variable by itself
",R2
"yes
",R0
"Because the number being by the variable means multiply and you want to do the opposite
",R2
"yes
",R0
"your welcome
",R0
"yes
",R0
"No. What is 15/2
",R0
"yes sorry. my bad
",R1
"yes
",R0
"also remember, when there is a number by itself do the opposite symbol it represented by
",R2
"can you solve this
",R0
"no
",R0
" you subtract
",R0
"5 was represented by a subtraction symbol. 4 is represented by an addition symbol. You do the opposite to get rid of the number
",R2
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"correct
",R0
"yes
",R0
"ok
",R0
"do you mean with the variable or without
",R0
"if the question was 5t/7=20, you would multiply with 7 because it's represented by a division symbol
",R2
"you could but then it might get confusing
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"yes
",R0
"do you want to do one more
",R0
"ok
",R0
"try this
",R0
"3
",R0
"let me help
",R0
"yo want to subtract 3 from 12
",R0
"can you be more specific
",R0
"it would be the same if it were -3+7g=12
",R0
" because although the 3 is a negative you you still do the opposite operation
 ",R2
ok I see where you are coming from,R0
"you can try it and lets see the outcome
",R0
"I am sorry!
",R1
"No noI think you are right.
",R0
"This step is wrong.
",R0
"I think I made a mistake.
",R1
Wait!..There is a mistake.,R1
mmmm.NoThis step looks wrong now.,R1
"There is something wrong here.

It is not.,R0
because x isnt by itself,R2
There are variables on bolth sides.,R2

2+3=5,R2
It will help you do other probelms,R0
it does not equal,R0
becuase i wanted to,R0
subtracting 1 will leave x remaining with the answer.,R2

4 is a coeffecient so you need to subtract 4x from 2x,R2
4 is a coeffecient so you need to subtract 4x from 2x,R2
Because I want to see if you can do it.,R0
you didnt completely solve it yet,R0
Because it is a more challenging problem.,R0
adding 2 to each side 1ould make it 9,R2
it helps me see how smart you are,R0
It will leave y with the correct answer.,R2
because i am the tutor and your the one that needs help.,R0
because 1 is a coefficient,R2
First you have to add 4 to both sides.,R0
"You first subtract 4, then multiply by 3.",R0
the coefficient 2 is negative so you need to divide by -2,R2
because now you have 2 variable terms,R2
because 10 is the answer,R0
It will leave y with the correct answer.,R0
that is not the right equation,R1
It will help you on these types of problems.,R0
you need to subtract 6 not 3,R1
there is more parts of the equation,R0
This will teach you more about equations that are tougher.,R0
it still works but you didn't add right,R1
First you would have to get the varible term by itself.,R2
because 6 multiplyed by 3 is not 36,R2

You must combine 2 like terms.,R2
how to finish the problem,R0
thereis nothing on that side,R0
"First, you combined like terms.",R2
2 isnt a coefficient,R2
have to combine like terms first,R2
have to combine like terms first,R2
"Because if you subtract 6b from both sides, you'll get a negative number.",R2
you need to add 2x to both sides,R0
there are 2 variable terms,R0
because there are like terms on both sides,R2
"You're right, Its -4.",R1
there is a -5,R0
You must divide.,R0

no you should multiply 4 by 2,R1
you add 7x and3x,R0

idk,R0
beacuse i wanted to know what u know,R0
because you have to add 10,R0
because you want to get n by it self,R2
yes,R0
just do it.,R0
ccuzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,R0
just do it,R0
so you can find the answer,R0

subtract 3 from 6and 15,R0
beacuse i want to see what you know and if u dont know i can help you,R0

idk,R0
cuz,R0
to see if u know it,R0
sorry you are right,R1
to see if u know it and if u dont i can help you,R0

you must get rid of that addition by adding before you move on to the next part,R2
it gets the x by itself and you get the answer to the answer,R2
thats a different problem,R0
