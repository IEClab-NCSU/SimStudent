[23:17:15] SetPreferences from the UI:
            the <skills> aggregate with its <skill/> children are embedded as full XML elements;
            note the <CommShellVersion>, from which we calculate the skill bar delimiter

[23:17:19] StartStateMessages is a bundle of all the start state messages, sent in a single transmission; it should be ok to send them singly; the contents:
            the InterfaceReboot message is not required at student time--you can leave it out;
            here's a complete StateGraph message: most of the elements are attributes from the brd's root element <stateGraph>;
                the <Skills> values in here are skillbars with the labels, to set the starting positions and names on the skillometer
            the InterfaceDescription and InterfaceAction messages come from the brd: you already do these fine;
            SendWidgetLock should be sent just before StartStateEnd; WidgetLockFlag is true if lockWidget="true" in the brd <stateGraph>

[23:19:01] SAI=[ansDen1,UpdateTextField,24] an out-of-order action with a special HighlightMsg as the 3rd response:

[23:19:49] SAI=[ansDen1,UpdateTextField,24] correct, because now in order

[23:19:56] SAI=[ansDenFinal1,UpdateTextField,12] correct

[23:20:02] SAI=[done,ButtonPressed,-1] incorrect with BuggyMessage for "not done": this is a fixed message used when not all required slinks are traversed

[23:20:25] ProblemSummaryRequest and Response: the UI will make this request after a done step is graded correct. In the response:
            the cmi* elements are for SCORM; we don't need these yet;
            the ProblemSummary is XML-escaped: change all "&lt;" to "<" and "&gt;" to ">" to see ordinary XML;
                the first part has the scores we calculate;
                the second part is the revised skills
